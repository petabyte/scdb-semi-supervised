Davis, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner. \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 586]\\n \\n Mr.E. J. Ellenwood, of New York City, for respondent.\\n\\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n The decision here turns upon the power of the Court of Claims, in light of  177(a) of the Judicial Code,1 to include interest in its award of 'just compensation' to a lessee for the construction of a hotel and other buildings pursuant to the provisions of the Act of March 30, 1920.2\\n The act of March 30, 1920, authorizes the Secretary of War to lease land on the United States Military Reservation at West Point, N.Y., to any person for a term not exceeding 50 years upon which to erect a hotel and other necessary buildings in connection therewith. The lease is to contain such conditions, terms, reservations and covenants as may be agreed upon and is to provide 'for just compensation to the lessees for the construction of said hotel, appurtenances, and equipments, to be paid to said lessees at the termination of said lease.'\\n On October 17, 1924, the Secretary of War duly made a lease under this Act to one Williams for a period of 50 years. The lease provided, among other things, that it might be cancelled at any time by the Secretary if the lessee should fail to observe all the covenants and conditions in the lease. One of the covenants was that the lessee was to 'keep the said hotel open for business every day during the continuance of this lease, except at such times as permission to close may be given in writing by the Superintendent, U.S.M.A.' Upon a cancellation of the lease, 'just compensation' was to be paid to the lessee for the construction of the hotel, appurtenances and equipment, and title thereto was to pass at once to the United States. \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 587]\\n \\n Similar provisions were made in connection with the termination of the lease on the expiration of the 50-year term. The lease also set forth numerous restrictions and requirements as to the operation of the hotel- such restrictions and requirements being primarily for the benefit of the Military Academy.\\n The lease was assigned to a corporation and a hotel and other buildings were subsequently erected. Through a series of events which need not be detailed here, the respondent took over the leasehold and the hotel properties in 1930 with the approval of the Superintendent of the Military Academy. Respondent began operating the hotel on January 1, 1931, and continued under the terms of the lease until March 10, 1943\\n\\n\\n On January 5, 1943, respondent wrote to the Secretary of War that conditions then existing made continued operation of the hotel impossible and that to avoid a curtailment of operations or a closing down of the hotel 'the properties should be owned and operated by the Government.' It was accordingly suggested that the Secretary declare the lease forfeited upon the closing of the hotel by respondent, a default contemplated by the lease. The Secretary agreed to this proposal. The respondent then gave notice of its intention to close the hotel on the morning of March 10, 1943. The agents of the Secretary immediately took over the possession, management and operation of the hotel on March 10 and shortly thereafter the Secretary declared the lease annulled.\\n The parties were unable to agree on the amount of 'just compensation' due under the lease. Respondent then brought this suit in the Court of Claims, praying for a judgment in the sum of $1,932.000. That court found that the 'total of just compensation to the plaintiff for construction of the hotel, its appurtenances, and equipments, is therefore $867,682, as of March 10, 1943.' 64 \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 588]\\n \\n F.Supp. 565, 568. The court then added interest at the rate of 4% per annum from March 10, 1943, to the date of payment as 'additional allowance to make compensation a just one as of the date of payment.' The sole question before us concerns the propriety of adding the 4% interest from March 10, 1943.\\n The pertinent part of  177(a) of the Judicial Code provides that 'No interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the phyment of interest, ....' Section 177(a) thus embodies the traditional rule that interest cannot be recovered against the United States upon unpaid accounts or claims in the absence of an express provision to the contrary in a relevant statute or contract. Tillson v. United States, \\n100 \\nU.S. 43\\n, 47; United States v. North American Transportation &amp; Trading Co., \\n253 \\nU.S. 30, 336\\n, 40 S.Ct. 518, 521; United States v. Goltra, \\n312 \\nU.S. 203, 207\\n, 61 S. Ct. 487, 490. This rule is inapplicable, however, where the United States takes property under its power of eminent domain; in such cases it has consistently been held that the Fifth Amendment's reference to 'just compensation' entitles the property owner to receive interest from the date of the taking to the date of payment as a part of his just compensation. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, \\n261 \\nU.S. 299, 306\\n, 43 S.Ct. 354, 356; Brooks-Scanlon Corporation v. United States, \\n265 \\nU.S. 106, 123\\n, 44 S.Ct. 471, 474; Phelps v. United States, \\n274 \\nU.S. 341, 344\\n, 47 S.Ct. 611, 612.\\n Since it is clear in the instant case that the United States did not exercise its power of eminent domain and that there was no taking of the hotel properties in the legal sense, we can put to one side the eminent domain situation. There is nothing more here than an ordinary contractual relationship between the United States and the respondent. That relationship was voluntarily entered into by respondent's predecessor and was severed at respondent's suggestion. The Government's liability to \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 589]\\n \\n pay for the construction of the hotel properties was fixed by the Act of March 30, 1920, and by the lease, not by the Constitution. The sole issue thus becomes whether there is any express provision in the Act or in the lease permitting the recovery of interest under the circumstances. Only if there is such a provision can respondent avoid the traditional rule set forth in  177(a).\\n Respondent's claim in this respect rests upon the references in the Act and in the lease to the payment of 'just compensation' for the construction of the hotel, appurtenances and equipment. 'Just compensation,' it is said, is to be given the same meaning here as in the case of a taking under the power of eminent domain, thereby entitling respondent to the full value of the properties down to the date of payment. From this viewpoint, the Court of Claims could use interest at the rate of 4% as the measure of the value of the use of the hotel properties from the time when the Government took possession on March 10, 1943, to the time of payment and include such interest as a component part of just compensation. The conclusion is reached that the term 'just compensation,' as used in the Act and in the lease, constitutes an express provision for interest so that the bar of  177(a) is removed. We cannot agree.\\n The fact that 'just compensation' includes interest in the eminent domain setting does not necessarily mean that the term must be given the same scope in other situations. United States v. Goltra, supra. It may or it may not imply an obligation to pay interest. For example, interest conceivably may not be contemplated where the term refers to compensatory damages for a tort or a breach of contract, or where it has reference to the price to be paid for the exchange or sale of property at a future date. Hence, in the absence of constitutional connotations, 'just compensation' is not a term of art so far as interest is \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 590]\\n \\n concerned. The inclusion or exclusion of interest depends upon other contractual provisions, the intention of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the use of the term.\\n But in order to override the historical rule codified in  177(a), something more is necessary than an equivocal use of the term 'just compensation.' It is not enough that the term might be construed to include the payment of interest. As  177(a) itself indicates, there must be a provision in the contract 'expressly stipulating for the payment of interest.' That provision must be affirmative, clear-cut, unambiguous; and an unexpressed intention by the parties that the term 'just compensation' be construed to include interest is insufficient. Likewise, where a statute is relied upon to overcome the force of  177(a), the intention of Congress to permit the rec very of interest must be expressly and specifically set forth in the statute. Tillson v. United States, supra, 100 U.S. at page 46; United States ex rel. Angarica de la Rua v. Bayard, \\n127 \\nU.S. 251, 260\\n, 8 S.Ct. 1156, 1160, 1161. Mere use of the term 'just compensation,' without more, is no substitute for an express provision for interest.\\n Here neither the Act of March 30, 1920, nor the lease under which respondent operated contains an express provision for the payment of interest, either in addition to or as a part of the 'just compensation' to be paid to respondent. If the United States had desired to provide by statute or to contract in the lease for the payment of interest, it would have been easy to have said so in express terms. \\n3\\n Because it did not say so, we are led irresistibly to the conclusion that it did not intend to negative the effect of  177(a) in this instance. Tillson v. United States, supra. \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 591]\\n \\n We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Claims to the extent that it includes an allowance for interest.\\n Reversed. \\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] 28 U.S.C.  284(a), 28 U.S.C.A.  284(a). \\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] 41 Stat. 538, 548. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 3\\n] Congress has expressly provided for the payment of interest in other instances.

Marvin Smith, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\\n Mr. Harold Simandl, of Newark, N.J., for petitioner.\\n\\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n The petitioner and one Chirichillo were convicted in a Federal District Court on all counts of a five-count indictment against them which charged violation of the Internal Revenue laws in connection with the operation of a still. The Court of Appeals reversed petitioner's conviction on counts four and five because of insufficient evidence, but affirmed as to counts one, two, and three. 3 Cir., 155 F.2d 592. We granted certiorari. \\n329 \\nU.S. 698\\n, 67 S.Ct. 58. Count one charged that the defendants had carried on 'the business of a distiller ... with intent willfully to defraud the ... United States of the tax on ... spirits so distilled ...' in violation of 26 U.S.C.  2833(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  2833(a). Count two charged them with having had possession and custody of the still in violation of 26 U.S.C.  2810(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  2810(a). Count three charged that they had made and fermented mash for the production of alcohol in violation of 26 U.S.C.  2834, 26 U. S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  2834. It is argued that the evidence was insufficient to support any of the three counts here at issue. The Government concedes its insufficiency as to counts two and three.\\n There was testimony to show the following: Chirichillo rented a farmhouse under an assumed name and installed a 300-gallon still with all equipment necessary to ferment mash and distill alcohol. The still was operated day and night. Chirichillo himself mixed the ingredients to make the mash in the attic of the 2 1/2-story frame building, but the alcohol distillation was carried on in another part of the building. Petitioner was at the house two or three times a week. When there he took instructions from \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 163]\\n \\n Chirichillo and helped him in the operation of the still; he helped manufacture the alcohol. When Chirichillo carried his products to Newark, the car in which he carried the illicitly distilled alcohol would follow along behind another car-sometimes petitioner's, sometimes another helper's. The farmhouse where the illicit business was carried on appeared from the outside to be deserted; the windows were without shades and the house had been practically stripped of furniture.\\n We accept the Government's concession that the evidence fails to show that this petitioner had made, or helped to make, the mash as charged in count three. All of the evidence showed that Chirichillo alone handled and mixed the ingredients of the mash, and there is nothing whatever to indicate that the petitioner ever took any part in, or aided and abetted, this particular part of the unlawful process in any manner, or, indeed, that he was ever in or around the attic where the mash was made from ingredients stored there. The Internal Revenue statutes have broken down the various steps and phases of a continuous illicit distilling business and made each of them a separate offense. Thus, these statutes have clearly carved out the conduct of making mash as a separate offense, thereby distinguishing it from the other offenses involving other steps and phases of the distilling business. Consequently, testimony to prove this separate offense of making mash must point directly to conduct within the narrow margins which the statute alone d fines. One who neither engages in the conduct specifically prohibited, nor aids and abets it, does not violate the section which prohibits it.\\n The sufficiency of the evidence as to count two which charged that the petitioner had custody or possession of the still is a closer question. It might be possible that petitioner's helping to make the alcohol aided and abetted in its 'custody or possession.' But that would be a very strained inference under any circumstances. Here again \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 164]\\n \\n the statutes treat custody or possession as a wholly distinct offense. Yet there was no testimony that the petitioner ever exercised, or aided the exercise of, any control over the distillery. His participation in carrying the finished product by car does not fit the category of 'custody and possession' so nearly as it resembles the transportation of illegal liquor, 26 U.S.C.  2803, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  2803-an offense which the Circuit Court of Appeals has found the evidence insufficient to prove. Nor was there any testimony that the petitioner acted in any other capacity calculated to facilitate the custody or possession, such as, for illustration, service as a caretaker, watchman, lookout, or in some other similar capacity. Under these circumstances, we accept the Government's concession that a judgment of guilty should not have been rendered on the second count.\\n We think there was adequate evidence to support a finding of guilt on the first count which charged operation of the business of distilling to defraud the Government of taxes. There was certainly ample evidence to show that Chirichillo carried on the business of a distiller and that the petitioner helped him to do it. 18 U.S.C.  550, 18 U.S.C.A.  550, provides that one who aids and abets another to commit a crime is guilty as a principal. Consequently, the jury had a right to find, as it did, that the petitioner and Chirichillo were equally guilty of operating the business of the distillery. See United States v. Johnson, \\n319 \\nU.S. 503, 515\\n, 518 S., 63 S.Ct. 1233, 1239, 1240\\n\\n\\n But, it is argued, there was no evidence that the petitioner acted with knowledge that the distillery business was carried on with an intent to defraud the Government of its taxes. The same evidence as to knowledge of this guilty purpose, however, that applied to Chirichillo was almost, if not quite, equally persuasive against both defendants. Petitioner assisted in the manufacture of alcohol in Chirichillo's still which was operated under con- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 165]\\n \\n ditions of secretiveness in an apparently abandoned farmhouse. The finished alcohol was carried to Newark in a car which followed another car, sometimes the petitioner's. The members of the jury could properly draw on their own experience and observations that lawful stills, unlike the still in which petitioner worked, usually are not operated clandestinely and do not deliver their products in the fashion employed here. The members of the jury were not precluded from drawing inferences as to fraudulent purposes from these circumstances, nor were they compelled to believe that this petitioner was oblivious of the purposes of what went on around him. Men in the jury box, like men on the street, can conclude that a person who actively helps to operate a secret distillery knows that he is helping to violate Government revenue laws. That is a well known object of an illicit distillery. Doubtless few who ever worked in such a place, or even heard about one, would fail to understand the cry: 'The Revenuers are coming!' We hold that the verdict of guilty on the first count must stand.\\n The only statute for violation of which petitioner's conviction is sustained by us carries a minimum mandatory sentence of fine of one hundred dollars and imprisonment, 26 U.S.C.  2833(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code,  2833(a). In announcing sentence at a morning session, the trial judge mentioned imprisonment only. Thereafter the petitioner was taken briefly to the U.S. Marshal's office and then to a local federal detention jail awaiting transportation to the penitentiary where he was finally to be confined. But about five hours after the sentence was announced, the judge recalled the petitioner and according to stipulation, stated in the presence of petitioner and his counsel that 'in the imposition of sentence this morning ... it has been called to my attention that there are certain mandatory fines and penalties which I omitted to impose. For the record now minimum mandatory fines and penalties will be imposed.' Thus a one \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 166]\\n \\n hundred dollar fine was fixed as required by law, along with the imprisonment sentence. Petitioner charges that this action constituted double jeopardy forbidden by the Federal Constitution.\\n It is well established that a sentence which does not comply with the letter of the criminal statute which authorizes it is so erroneous that it may be set aside on appeal, Reynolds v. United States, \\n98 \\nU.S. 145, 168\\n, 169 S., 8 Otto 145, 168, 169; Murphy v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \\n177 \\nU.S. 155, 157\\n, 20 S.Ct. 639, 640, or in habeas corpus proceedings. In re Bonner, \\n151 \\nU.S. 242\\n, 14 S.Ct. 323. But in those cases it was recognized that an excessive sentence should be corrected, even though the prisoner had already served part of his term, not by absolute discharge of the prisoner, but by an appropriate amendment of the invalid sentence by the court of original jurisdiction, at least during the term of court in which the invalid sentence was imposed. \\n1\\n Cf. De Benque v. United States, 66 App.D.C. 36, 85 F.2d 202, 106 A.L.R. 839. In the light of these cases, the fact that petitioner has been twice before the judge for sentencing and in a federal place of detention during the five hour interim cannot be said to constitute double jeopardy as we have heretofore considered it. Petitioner contends, however, that these cases are inapplicable here because correction of this sentence so as to make it lawful increases his punishment. Cf. United States v. Benz, \\n282 \\nU.S. 304, 309\\n, 51 S.Ct. 113, 114. If this inadvertent error cannot be corrected in the manner used here by the trial court, no valid and enforceable sentence can be imposed at all. Cf. Jordan v. United States, 4 Cir., 60 F.2d 4, 6 with Barrow v. United States, 54 App.D.C. 128, 295 F. 949. This Court has rejected the 'doctrine that a prisoner, whose guilt is established by a regular verdict, is to escape punishment altogether because the court committed an error in passing the sentence.' In re Bonner, supra, 151 U.S. at page 260, 14 S.Ct. at page 327. The Constitution does not require that sentencing should be a game \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 167]\\n \\n in which a wrong move by the judge means immunity for the prisoner. See King v. United States, 69 App.D.C. 10, 98 F.2d 291, 296. In this case the court 'only set aside what it had no authority to do, and substitute(d) directions required by the law to be done upon the conviction of the offender.' In re Bonner, supra, 151 U.S. at page 260, 14 S.Ct. at page 327. It did not twice put petitioner in jeopardy for the same offense. \\n2\\n The sentence as corrected, imposes a valid punishment for an offense instead of an invalid punishment for that offense.\\n Other contentions here do not merit our discussion. The judgment as to count one is affirmed. The judgment is reversed as to counts two and three.\\n It is so ordered.\\n Affirmed in part and reversed in part.\\n\\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Mr. Justice MURPHY, and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE dissenting as to the affirmance of the judgment on count one.\\n We are of the view that to convict one as an aider and abetter in engaging in or carrying on a distillery business with intent 'to defraud' the United States of the tax on the distilled spirits, 53 Stat. 319, 26 U. S.C.  2833(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  2833(a), evidence is necessary which shows that by some act of concealment he promoted the fraud, or by counsel and advice furthered the unlawful scheme, or in fact had \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 168]\\n \\n some interest in the project. 1 See United States v. Cooper, 25 Fed.Cas. pages 627, 629, No. 14,863; United States v. Logan, 26 Fed.Cas. pages 900, 992, No. 15,624; Seiden v. United States, 2 Cir., 16 F.2d 197, 199; Partson v. United States, 8 Cir., 20 F.2d 127, 129; Anderson v. United States, 5 Cir., 30 F.2d 485, 487. Aiding and abetting in the illicit manufacture of liquor is one thing. \\n2\\n Aiding and abetting in carrying on the business with intent to defraud the United States of a tax is quite a different matter, and requires a different test, if the two offenses are not to be blended. The evidence in the case and the instructions given the jury3 seem to us inadequate to sustain a con- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 169]\\n \\n viction under count one, charging Bozza with aiding and abetting in a tax fraud scheme.\\n In view of this conclusion, Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE reserves expression of opinion concerning the legality of the sentence. \\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] Compare Rule 45(c), Rules of Criminal Procedure for the District Courts of the United States, 18 U.S.C.A. following section 687. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] In Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, relied on by petitioner here, the defendant had been sentenced to fine and imprisonment for violation of a statute which authorized a sentence only of fine or imprisonment. Since he had paid his fine and therefore suffered punishment under a valid sentence, it was held that his sentence had been 'executed by full satisfaction of one of the alternative penalties of the law ....' Murphy v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, supra, 177 U.S. at page 160, 20 S. Ct. at page 641. Therefore, Lange's plea, that the trial court could not correct the sentenc without causing him to suffer double punishment, was sustained. Cf. In re Bradley, \\n318 \\nU.S. 50\\n, 63 S.Ct. 470. But here the petitioner had not suffered any lawful punishment until the court had announced the full mandatory sentence of imprisonment and fine. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] Judge Learned Hand, after reviewing the various definitions of aiding and abetting, said: 'It will be observed that all these definitions have nothing whatever to do with the probability that the forbidden result would follow upon the accessory's conduct; and that they all demand that he in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed. All the words used-even the most colorless, 'abet'-carry an implication of purposive attitude towards it.' United States v. Peoni, 2 Cir., 100 F.2d 401, 402. \\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] Thus  2833(a) makes it an offense to 'carry on the business of a distiller without having given bond as required by law.' Section 2834 makes it unlawful to make or ferment mash, fit for distillation, in any building or on any premises other than an authorized distillery. \\n[\\nFootnote 3\\n] '... if you find that he was merely an underling, serving at the beck and call of an employer and nothing more than that (sic) would not justify your finding him to be engaged in the business of a distiller. But if from the evidence you conclude logically that he aided and abetted in the carrying on of this business, then he would be chargeable as a principal. ... Aiding and abetting is something more than merely committing an act which may have the effect of assisting or furthering a criminal transaction. Before a defendant can be held as an aider and abetter the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed an act which furthered or assisted the criminal transaction, and at the time he committed the act he knew that a crime was in process of commission, and with that knowledge he acted with intent to aid and abet in the criminal transaction.' While the above charges were requested by defendant, we nevertheless feel that the failure of the instructions to satisfy the standard we suggest is an error which we should notice. Sibbach v.

United States \\n330 \\nU.S. 169\\n (1947) ]\\n\\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 171]\\n \\n Mr. Ernest L. Wilkinson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\\n Mr. Marvin J. Sonosky, of Washington D.C., for respondent.\\n\\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n Petitioners brought this action in the Court of Claims under the Act of June 28, 1938, 52 Stat. 1209, as amended, 55 Stat. 593, to recover compensation for lands made available to them by an 1875 Executive Order of the President and sub-sequently taken from them by the United States. Their claim was that by an Act of June 15, 1880, 21 Stat. 199, Congress had undertaken to sell these lands for the benefit of the petitioners, but that they had never been compensated for them. The Court of Claims, one judge concurring specially, made findings of fact and concluded as a matter of law that petitioners had no compensable interest in the lands because they 'never did acquire title to these ... lands and ... the Congress never did agree to sell them for the account of' petitioners. Ct. Cl., 64 F.Supp. 569, 571. We granted certiorari, \\n329 \\nU.S. 694\\n, 67 S.Ct. 50.\\n The findings of the Court of Claims from official letters, Executive Orders and statutes incorporated in these findings were as follows: \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 172]\\n \\n A treaty of March 2, 1868, 15 Stat. 619, between the United States and petitioners' ancestors, the Ute Indian tribes, established a reservation for them in Colorado. The northern boundary of the 15 million acres there ceded was described in the treaty as a line fifteen miles north of, and parallel to the 40th parallel of north latitude. In the 15- mile wide strip north of the 40th parallel lay the White River Valley which had been settled by the Utes as a most suitable place for grazing and cultivation. One of the two Government Indian agencies provided for the reservation by the treaty was established in that strip.\\n As a result of misunderstandings in 1869 and 1874 between the Utes and white settlers to the north as to the true location of the northern treaty boundary, a survey was made in 1875 by one Miller. Miller's instructions, however, required him to stake out a line which he admitted to the local Indian agent and to the Utes themselves to be fifteen to eighteen miles south of the true boundary described in the treaty. If Miller's line had been correct, it would have excluded from the 1868 reservation the fertile White River Valley, and would have also excluded the agency buildings which had been erected there.\\n The marking out of the erroneous Miller line greatly upset the Indians because they feared they would be driven from the White River Valley. This embarrassed the local Indian agent who had previously assured the Indians that the White River Valley lay within their reservation. He promptly reported the results of the survey and the reaction of the Indians to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, and urged the necessity of a new survey at the earliest practicable date. He stated that if the Miller survey were correct, however, the Indians would be driven from the White River Valley-'the only farming land and stock range in this part of the reservation'-and forced to settle on \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 173]\\n \\n a river forty miles to the south. The Commissioner, acting on this report and a statement by Miller's attorney that Miller's line was correct, wrote to the Secretary of the Interior that the Miller survey 'develops the fact that the White River and surrounding valleys as well as the Agency buildings and improvements at the White River Agency lie north of the ... boundary and consequently are not within the limits of the ... Ute Reservation.' He therefore recommended to the Secretary that the President be requested to issue an Executive Order to make available to the Utes additional territory north of the 1868 treaty boundary. The President, on t e recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, issued the order. \\n1\\n And thereafter the Commissioner wrote the local agent that the order included 'all that tract of country lying between the north boundary of the Ute reservation as defined in the treaty of March 2, 1868 ... which was the boundary surveyed by Mr. Miller. ... This action fully protects your Indians in the peaceable possession of their improvements in the White River Valley and the Agency buildings, and will enable you to assure the Indians of the exact location of their reservation as enlarged.' \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 174]\\n \\n In 1879, several years after the Executive Order was issued, hostilities broke out between some of the Utes and Government representatives in which the Indian agent at White River, all the agency's male employees, and a U.S. military detachment were killed in the so- called 'Meeker massacre.' Ex. Doc. No. 1, pt. 5, 47th Cong., 2d Sess. ( 1879) 16-19, 82-97. There have been charges and counter-charges as to who was responsible for inciting these hostilities. Whoever was responsible, it is clear that Congress, aroused by the massacre, took steps to punish the Indians who participated in it, to dispossess the Utes of their reservation, and to remove them from Colorado. Congressional action to accomplish this was provided by the Act of June 15, 1880, 21 Stat. 199, which ratified and embodied an agreement reached earlier that year between the Government and the leaders of the Utes who had promised 'to use their best endeavors with their people to procure their consent to cede to the United States all the territory of the present Ute Reservation ....' This Act authorized specific allotments to individual Indians from the lands so ceded. But  3 provided that 'all the lands not ... allotted, the title to which is, by the said agreement of ... the Ute Indians, and this acceptance by the United States, released and conveyed to the United States ...' would be restored to the public domain for sale as public lands. The proceeds of the sale of the land so conveyed by the Utes to the United States were, upon satisfaction of indemnity conditions imposed because of the massacre, to be distributed to the Indians. Thereafter, in 1882, an Executive Order declared that the lands withdrawn from the public domain by the Executive Order of 1875 and 'set apart for the use of the ... Ute Indians ... hereby is, restored to the public domain.' 1 Kappler, supra, pp. 834, 834.\\n Pursuant to an Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 781, petitioners recovered a judgment for the proceeds of certain lands sold \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 175]\\n \\n by the Government, as well as the value of certain lands appropriated by the Government to its own use, all of which were part of the 1868 treaty lands. The Ute Indians v. United States, 45 Ct.Cl. 440; 46 Ct.Cl. 225. Thus, except for certain treaty lands not at issue here, litigation concerning which is now pending in the Court of Claims, the only lands in Colorado for which the Indians have not been paid are those to the north of and outside the 1868 treaty reservation which were made avail ble to them by the Executive Order of 1875. In pursuit of compensation for these Executive Order lands, petitioners have brought this action pursuant to the Act of June 28, 1938, supra. That Act confers jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to hear, determine, and render final judgment on all legal and equitable claims of the Utes and to award judgment for the Indians where it is found 'that any lands formerly belonging' to them 'have been taken by the United States without compensation ....'\\n Petitioners contend here that their predecessors understood that they not only owned the White River Valley lands, but that they also owned the Executive Order lands when, in 1880, they agreed to cede their reservation; and that Congress, by incorporating the agreement in the 1880 Act, thereby ratified it along with the Indians' understanding of it. Petitioners further contend that whether or not Congress intended to obligate the Government to account for the Executive Order lands, they knew of the Indians' understanding so that 'the understanding of the Indians having been established,' their understanding entitles them to recover. Finally they argue that the Executive Order unlike the one in issue in Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, \\n316 \\nU.S. 317\\n, 62 S.Ct. 1095, conveyed a compensable interest to these Indians. The Government counters that the President had no power to give a compensable interest to the Indians to lands lying outside the true 1868 treaty boundaries; that if the President intended \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 176]\\n \\n to make available lands outside the true boundary it was only to give a transitory, possessory, and not a compensable, interest; that his intent was, in fact, only to secure the Indians in their possession of the White River Valley, but no more, on the mistaken assumption that the White River Valley had been cut off from the reservation by the Miller survey; that the 1880 Act, neither by its terms, its legislative history, nor its administrative interpretation, suggests that Congress intended to ratify or expand the Executive Order or to compensate the Indians for the Executive Order lands; that the Indians did not have a contrary understanding; that in the face of such clear legislative language and intent, a contrary understanding of the Indians, even if established, could not justify a holding that the Indians obtained a compensable interest.\\n It is conceded that the petitioners have either been, or are currently pressing litigation in the Court of Claims by which they seek to be, compensated for the White River Valley lands, and in fact, for all of the land which was contained in the true boundaries of the 1868 reservation. The additional claim, insofar as it rests on the Executive Order of 1875, cannot be sustained. For the President had no authority to convey to the petitioners a compensable interest in the lands described in the order lying north of the true 1868 boundary. Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, supra. \\n2\\n Nor is there any indication in the findings that the President intended to convey more than a transitory, possessory interest by the 1875 Order. That order made the Indians no more than tenants at the will of the Government on that part of the land outside the true treaty reservation. Id. 316 U.S. at page 331, 62 S.Ct. at page 1101. Moreover, the Court of Claims' findings of fact, as emphasized \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 177]\\n \\n by the special concurring opinion, indicate that the Executive Order was promulgated under the mistaken belief that its issuance was necessary in order to give the Indians the use of the White River Valley lands intended to be granted to them by the 1868 treaty and from which they might otherwise have been excluded by the Miller survey. These findings do not indicate that the Commissioner, the Secretary, or the President intended the order to make available the lands it in fact described lying north of the true treaty boundary. The order was designed only to resolve the misunderstanding created by Miller about the White River Valley lands. \\n3\\n The fullest possible purpose of the Executive Order has actually been carried out. For the Indians' enjoyment of the White River lands was protected during their stay on the reservation, and the lands have either already been paid for, or are the subject of pending litigation in the Court of Claims whereby the Indians seek payment for them. It is with these things in mind that we must consider petitioner's contention that they have a right to recover compensation because of the 1880 Act.\\n There is not one word in that Act showing a congressional purpose to convey the Executive Order lands, or any other lands, to the Indians. On the contrary, the Act embodied a transaction whereby the Indians were the transferors and conveyed lands to the Government. For the value of lands so conveyed, and for no other, the Government was to make an account to the Indians after certain deductions had been made. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 178]\\n \\n Nor is it possible to deduce from the 1880 Act a congressional purpose to transform the Executive Order into a conveyance of something more than a mere temporary and cancellable possessory right to the Indians. Neither the language of the 1880 Act, its legislative history, nor the circumstances which brought it about, justify the claim that Congress intended to expand the Executive Order into a transfer of a compensable interest in lands not included in the original treaty reservation. The Act was an aftermath of the 'Meeker massacre.' With the massacre in mind, Congress decided to remove the Indians from the Colorado reservation as part of the punishment meted out for this tragedy. \\n4\\n The very first section of the 1880 Act prohibited any payments at all to the Indians until the Indians involved had surrendered, been apprehended, or until the President had proof that they were dead or outside the United States. Compensation for the families of the massacre victims was to be deducted from the land sale proceeds payable to the Indians. We cannot find from this background a congressional purpose to make a gift to the Indians of the Executive Order lands for which compensation is here sought. The only lands for which Congress agreed in 1880 to compensate the Indians were those that 'the title to which' the Indians then 'released and conveyed to the United States.' They could only release and convey the lands that belonged to them, and only the lands given to them by the original 1868 treaty belonged to them. It was for compensation for such lands only that Congress, in 1938, authorized this action to be maintained. Under all these circumstances, the fact that the 1880 Act required the chiefs and headmen to procure the consent of their people to the cession of 'the present Ute Reservation,' is not sufficient to attribute to Congress \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 179]\\n \\n a purpose to treat as a part of that reservation, lands which had never been legally conveyed to the Indians and which had only been made available to them by the Executive Order for the sole purpose of making them secure in their possession of the White River Valley.\\n It is said, however, that the Indians understood in 1880 that they owned the Executive Order lands which lay north of the White River Valley; that they understood their 'present Ute reservation' to include them; that they understood that Congress undertook by the 1880 Act to sell the lands for their benefit; and that Congress was aware of this understanding. The majority opinion of the Court of Claims stated that 'in all probability' this was true. The writer of the concurring opinion thought differently. But even if the Indians had believed that they had a compensable interest in the Executive Order lands, this fact would not necessarily have given it to them. Certainly the absence of presidential authority to give them a compensable title could not be supplied by the Indians' understanding that the President had such authority. The Sioux Indians may also have thought the President had authority to convey title to them; but the reasons on which our decision in the Sioux case, supra, rested do not indicate that our holding depended in any way upon the understanding of the Indians. Nor can this alleged understanding be imputed to Congress in the face of plain language and a rather full legislative history indicating that the 1880 Act neither conveyed nor ratified conveyance of these lands. While it has long been the rule that a treaty with Indians is to be construed so as to carry out the Government's obligations in accordance with the fair understanding of the Indians, we cannot, under the guise of interpretation, create Presidential authority where there was none, nor rewrite congressional acts so as to make them mean something they obviously were not intended to mean. Choctaw Nation of Indians v. United \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 180]\\n \\n States, \\n318 \\nU.S. 423, 431\\n, 432 S., 63 S.Ct. 672, 677, 678. We cannot, under any acceptable rule of interpretation, hold that the Indians owned the lands merely because they thought so. Solicitous as the Government is to carry out its promises to the Indians in good faith, we are satisfied from this record that the Government has performed all that it promised.\\n As we have pointed out, it seems obvious to us from the findings of the Court of Claims that the Executive Order was only intended to secure for these Indians' ancestors possession of the White River Valley lands conveyed to them by the original 1868 treaty, and which was jeopardized by the Miller survey. 5 In fact, the President had no authority to convey a compensable interest in these or other lands to the Utes. Fairly to carry out the 1868 treaty was the order's aim. The 1880 Act, we believe, did not enlarge upon the limited purpose of the Executive Order. To compensate these Indians for lands, not intended to be conveyed by the 1868 treaty, the Executive Order, nor the 1880 Act, would be to pay them for lands which neither they nor their ancestors ever owned and to which they had no claim in equity or justice, so far as the transactions here at issue are concerned. No rule of construction justifies such a result.\\nAFFIRMED.\\n\\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\\n The United States, in my opinion, is morally and legally obligated to pay for the land in issue in this case. The Executive Order of 1875 by its terms set aside certain land up to the 'first standard parallel north' for the use of the Ute Indians 'as an addition to their present reservation.' That order alone, of course, could convey no compensable interest to the Indians under the rule of Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, \\n316 \\nU.S. 317\\n, 62 S.Ct. 1095. But events subsequent to \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 181]\\n \\n the issuance of the Executive Order in this case make inapplicable the principle of the Sioux case. In 1880 the United States and the Ute chiefs and headmen entered into an agreement whereby the latter promised 'to use their best endeavors with their people to procure their consent to cede to the United States all the territory of the present Ute Rese vation in Colorado.' Congress thereupon passed the Act of June 15, 1880, which recited in its preamble that the chiefs and headmen had 'submitted to the Secretary of the Interior an agreement for the sale to the United States of their present reservation in the State of Colorado.' The Act then incorporated the agreement previously made and provided that all unallotted lands should be deemed to be released and conveyed to the United States.\\n It seems clear to me that by 1880 the term 'present reservation' included the land which the Executive Order of 1875 stated had been set aside as an addition to the then present reservation. And when the 1880 agreement and the 1880 Act referred to 'present reservation' they must have included that additional land. Adding this informal acknowledgment by Congress of the expanded reservation to the occupation of the land by the Indians and their understaning that it belonged to the reservation, a compensable interest becomes evident. It is immaterial that there was no formal documents conveying a fee simple interest to the Indians; it is likewise irrelevant that there was no formal acknowledgment of the Indian title. Spalding v. Chandler, \\n160 \\nU.S. 394\\n, 16 S.Ct. 360; United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, \\n329 \\nU.S. 40\\n, 67 S.Ct. 167. It is enough that the Indians had the right to possess and occupy the land and that the Indians fairly understood that to be the case. An acknowledgment by Congress, however informal, then adds a legal obligation to the moral duty of the United States to pay for the land involved. Such is the situation here. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 182]\\n \\n The Court indicates, however, that the Executive Order of 1875 does not mean what it says. It clearly set apart for the use of the Indians 'as an addition to the present reservation' all the described land up to the 'first standard parallel north.' But it is now suggested that those responsible for the promulgation of that order did not really intend to set aside all the land up to the 'first standard parallel north,' despite the explicit language used. It is said, rather, that the order actually was designed to affect only the White River Valley lands-lands which are some nine miles south of the 'first standard parallel north.' That interpretation of the intent of the framers of the order would make the northern boundary of the Executive Order land coterminous with the northern boundary of the true treaty reservation.\\n But there is nothing in the findings of the Court of Claims to justify such an interpretation. To disregard the plain words of the order by subtracting a nine-mile strip from a clearly worded description requires definite findings to that effect which are supported by the record. It is not our function, of course, to supply those findings ourselves. Nor can we infer them from the decision of the Court of Claims. That court alone has the power and the duty to make the necessary findings on material issues. 53 Stat. 752, 28 U.S.C.  288, 28 U.S.C.A.  288; United States v. Causby, \\n328 \\nU.S. 256, 267\\n, 268 S., 66 S.Ct. 1062, 1068, 1069. If it is material that the framers of the Executive Order intended to set aside less land than that described in the order, the case should be remanded to the Court of Claims so that it can make the necessary findings in this respect.\\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join in this dissent. \\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] The Executive Order of November 22, 1875, 1 Kappler, Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties, p. 834 (1904) is as follows:\\n'It is hereby ordered that the tract of country in the Territory of Colorado lying within the following-described boundaries, viz: Commencing at the northeast corner of the present Ute Indian Reservation, as defined in the treaty of March 2, 1868 (Stats. at Large, vol. 15, p. 619); thence running north on the 107th degree of longitude to the first standard parallel north; thence west on said first standard parallel to the boundary line between Colorado and Utah; thence south with said boundary to the northwest corner of the Ute Indian Reservation; thence east with the north boundary of the said reservation to the place of beginning, be, and the same hereby is, withdrawn from sale and set apart for the use of the several tribes of Ute Indians, as an addition to the present reservation in said Territory.' \\n\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] Cf. Executive Order of August 17, 1876, which interpreted a treaty so as to 'set apart (certain land) as a part of the Ute Indian Reservation, in accordance with the first article of an agreement made with said Indians and ratified by Congress. ...' 1 Kappler, supra, p. 834. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 3\\n] The Court of Claims did not find this as an ultimate fact. But the correspondence which plainly shows it was incorporated in the findings. This Court has said with reference to findings of the Court of Claims that the 'absence of the finding of an ultimate fact does not require a reversal of the judgment if the circumstantial facts as found are such that the ultimate fact follows from them as a necessary inference.'

UNITED STATES(1947), No. 141 Argued: Decided: February 17, 1947 As Amended March 31, 1947.[ Confederated Bands of Ute Indians v. United States 330 U.S. 169 (1947) ] [330 U.S. 169, 171] Mr. Ernest L. Wilkinson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners., Mr. Marvin J. Sonosky, of Washington D.C., for respondent., Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court., Petitioners brought this action in the Court of Claims under the Act of June 28, 1938, 52 Stat. 1209, as amended, 55 Stat. 593, to recover compensation for lands made available to them by an 1875 Executive Order of the President and sub-sequently taken from them by the United States., Their claim was that by an Act of June 15, 1880, 21 Stat. 199, Congress had undertaken to sell these lands for the benefit of the petitioners, but that they had never been compensated for them., The Court of Claims, one judge concurring specially, made findings of fact and concluded as a matter of law that petitioners had no compensable interest in the lands because they 'never did acquire title to these ... lands and ..., the Congress never did agree to sell them for the account of' petitioners., Ct. Cl., 64 F.Supp. 569, 571., We granted certiorari, 329 U.S. 694 , 67 S.Ct. 50., The findings of the Court of Claims from official letters, Executive Orders and statutes incorporated in these findings were as follows: [330 U.S. 169, 172] A treaty of March 2, 1868, 15 Stat. 619, between the United States and petitioners' ancestors, the Ute Indian tribes, established a reservation for them in Colorado., The northern boundary of the 15 million acres there ceded was described in the treaty as a line fifteen miles north of, and parallel to the 40th parallel of north latitude., In the 15- mile wide strip north of the 40th parallel lay the White River Valley which had been settled by the Utes as a most suitable place for grazing and cultivation., One of the two Government Indian agencies provided for the reservation by the treaty was established in that strip., As a result of misunderstandings in 1869 and 1874 between the Utes and white settlers to the north as to the true location of the northern treaty boundary, a survey was made in 1875 by one Miller., Miller's instructions, however, required him to stake out a line which he admitted to the local Indian agent and to the Utes themselves to be fifteen to eighteen miles south of the true boundary described in the treaty., If Miller's line had been correct, it would have excluded from the 1868 reservation the fertile White River Valley, and would have also excluded the agency buildings which had been erected there., The marking out of the erroneous Miller line greatly upset the Indians because they feared they would be driven from the White River Valley., This embarrassed the local Indian agent who had previously assured the Indians that the White River Valley lay within their reservation., He promptly reported the results of the survey and the reaction of the Indians to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, and urged the necessity of a new survey at the earliest practicable date., He stated that if the Miller survey were correct, however, the Indians would be driven from the White River Valley-'the only farming land and stock range in this part of the reservation'-and forced to settle on [330 U.S. 169, 173] a river forty miles to the south., The Commissioner, acting on this report and a statement by Miller's attorney that Miller's line was correct, wrote to the Secretary of the Interior that the Miller survey 'develops the fact that the White River and surrounding valleys as well as the Agency buildings and improvements at the White River Agency lie north of the ... boundary and consequently are not within the limits of the ..., Ute Reservation.', He therefore recommended to the Secretary that the President be requested to issue an Executive Order to make available to the Utes additional territory north of the 1868 treaty boundary., The President, on t e recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, issued the order., 1 And thereafter the Commissioner wrote the local agent that the order included 'all that tract of country lying between the north boundary of the Ute reservation as defined in the treaty of March 2, 1868 ..., which was the boundary surveyed by Mr. Miller. ..., This action fully protects your Indians in the peaceable possession of their improvements in the White River Valley and the Agency buildings, and will enable you to assure the Indians of the exact location of their reservation as enlarged.' [330 U.S. 169, 174], In 1879, several years after the Executive Order was issued, hostilities broke out between some of the Utes and Government representatives in which the Indian agent at White River, all the agency's male employees, and a U.S. military detachment were killed in the so- called 'Meeker massacre.' Ex. Doc. No. 1, pt. 5, 47th Cong., 2d Sess. ( 1879) 16-19, 82-97., There have been charges and counter-charges as to who was responsible for inciting these hostilities., Whoever was responsible, it is clear that Congress, aroused by the massacre, took steps to punish the Indians who participated in it, to dispossess the Utes of their reservation, and to remove them from Colorado., Congressional action to accomplish this was provided by the Act of June 15, 1880, 21 Stat. 199, which ratified and embodied an agreement reached earlier that year between the Government and the leaders of the Utes who had promised 'to use their best endeavors with their people to procure their consent to cede to the United States all the territory of the present Ute Reservation ....', This Act authorized specific allotments to individual Indians from the lands so ceded., But 3 provided that 'all the lands not ... allotted, the title to which is, by the said agreement of ..., the Ute Indians, and this acceptance by the United States, released and conveyed to the United States ...' would be restored to the public domain for sale as public lands., The proceeds of the sale of the land so conveyed by the Utes to the United States were, upon satisfaction of indemnity conditions imposed because of the massacre, to be distributed to the Indians., Thereafter, in 1882, an Executive Order declared that the lands withdrawn from the public domain by the Executive Order of 1875 and 'set apart for the use of the ..., Ute Indians ... hereby is, restored to the public domain.', 1 Kappler, supra, pp. 834, 834., Pursuant to an Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 781, petitioners recovered a judgment for the proceeds of certain lands sold [330 U.S. 169, 175] by the Government, as well as the value of certain lands appropriated by the Government to its own use, all of which were part of the 1868 treaty lands., The Ute Indians v. United States, 45 Ct.Cl. 440; 46 Ct.Cl. 225., Thus, except for certain treaty lands not at issue here, litigation concerning which is now pending in the Court of Claims, the only lands in Colorado for which the Indians have not been paid are those to the north of and outside the 1868 treaty reservation which were made avail ble to them by the Executive Order of 1875., In pursuit of compensation for these Executive Order lands, petitioners have brought this action pursuant to the Act of June 28, 1938, supra., That Act confers jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to hear, determine, and render final judgment on all legal and equitable claims of the Utes and to award judgment for the Indians where it is found 'that any lands formerly belonging' to them 'have been taken by the United States without compensation ....', Petitioners contend here that their predecessors understood that they not only owned the White River Valley lands, but that they also owned the Executive Order lands when, in 1880, they agreed to cede their reservation; and that Congress, by incorporating the agreement in the 1880 Act, thereby ratified it along with the Indians' understanding of it., Petitioners further contend that whether or not Congress intended to obligate the Government to account for the Executive Order lands, they knew of the Indians' understanding so that 'the understanding of the Indians having been established,' their understanding entitles them to recover., Finally they argue that the Executive Order unlike the one in issue in Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, 316 U.S. 317 , 62 S.Ct. 1095, conveyed a compensable interest to these Indians., The Government counters that the President had no power to give a compensable interest to the Indians to lands lying outside the true 1868 treaty boundaries; that if the President intended [330 U.S. 169, 176] to make available lands outside the true boundary it was only to give a transitory, possessory, and not a compensable, interest; that his intent was, in fact, only to secure the Indians in their possession of the White River Valley, but no more, on the mistaken assumption that the White River Valley had been cut off from the reservation by the Miller survey; that the 1880 Act, neither by its terms, its legislative history, nor its administrative interpretation, suggests that Congress intended to ratify or expand the Executive Order or to compensate the Indians for the Executive Order lands; that the Indians did not have a contrary understanding; that in the face of such clear legislative language and intent, a contrary understanding of the Indians, even if established, could not justify a holding that the Indians obtained a compensable interest., It is conceded that the petitioners have either been, or are currently pressing litigation in the Court of Claims by which they seek to be, compensated for the White River Valley lands, and in fact, for all of the land which was contained in the true boundaries of the 1868 reservation., The additional claim, insofar as it rests on the Executive Order of 1875, cannot be sustained., For the President had no authority to convey to the petitioners a compensable interest in the lands described in the order lying north of the true 1868 boundary., Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, supra., 2 Nor is there any indication in the findings that the President intended to convey more than a transitory, possessory interest by the 1875 Order., That order made the Indians no more than tenants at the will of the Government on that part of the land outside the true treaty reservation., Id. 316 U.S. at page 331, 62 S.Ct. at page 1101., Moreover, the Court of Claims' findings of fact, as emphasized [330 U.S. 169, 177] by the special concurring opinion, indicate that the Executive Order was promulgated under the mistaken belief that its issuance was necessary in order to give the Indians the use of the White River Valley lands intended to be granted to them by the 1868 treaty and from which they might otherwise have been excluded by the Miller survey., These findings do not indicate that the Commissioner, the Secretary, or the President intended the order to make available the lands it in fact described lying north of the true treaty boundary., The order was designed only to resolve the misunderstanding created by Miller about the White River Valley lands., 3 The fullest possible purpose of the Executive Order has actually been carried out., For the Indians' enjoyment of the White River lands was protected during their stay on the reservation, and the lands have either already been paid for, or are the subject of pending litigation in the Court of Claims whereby the Indians seek payment for them., It is with these things in mind that we must consider petitioner's contention that they have a right to recover compensation because of the 1880 Act., There is not one word in that Act showing a congressional purpose to convey the Executive Order lands, or any other lands, to the Indians., On the contrary, the Act embodied a transaction whereby the Indians were the transferors and conveyed lands to the Government., For the value of lands so conveyed, and for no other, the Government was to make an account to the Indians after certain deductions had been made. [330 U.S. 169, 178], Nor is it possible to deduce from the 1880 Act a congressional purpose to transform the Executive Order into a conveyance of something more than a mere temporary and cancellable possessory right to the Indians., Neither the language of the 1880 Act, its legislative history, nor the circumstances which brought it about, justify the claim that Congress intended to expand the Executive Order into a transfer of a compensable interest in lands not included in the original treaty reservation., The Act was an aftermath of the 'Meeker massacre.', With the massacre in mind, Congress decided to remove the Indians from the Colorado reservation as part of the punishment meted out for this tragedy., 4 The very first section of the 1880 Act prohibited any payments at all to the Indians until the Indians involved had surrendered, been apprehended, or until the President had proof that they were dead or outside the United States., Compensation for the families of the massacre victims was to be deducted from the land sale proceeds payable to the Indians., We cannot find from this background a congressional purpose to make a gift to the Indians of the Executive Order lands for which compensation is here sought., The only lands for which Congress agreed in 1880 to compensate the Indians were those that 'the title to which' the Indians then 'released and conveyed to the United States.', They could only release and convey the lands that belonged to them, and only the lands given to them by the original 1868 treaty belonged to them., It was for compensation for such lands only that Congress, in 1938, authorized this action to be maintained., Under all these circumstances, the fact that the 1880 Act required the chiefs and headmen to procure the consent of their people to the cession of 'the present Ute Reservation,' is not sufficient to attribute to Congress [330 U.S. 169, 179] a purpose to treat as a part of that reservation, lands which had never been legally conveyed to the Indians and which had only been made available to them by the Executive Order for the sole purpose of making them secure in their possession of the White River Valley., It is said, however, that the Indians understood in 1880 that they owned the Executive Order lands which lay north of the White River Valley; that they understood their 'present Ute reservation' to include them; that they understood that Congress undertook by the 1880 Act to sell the lands for their benefit; and that Congress was aware of this understanding., The majority opinion of the Court of Claims stated that 'in all probability' this was true., The writer of the concurring opinion thought differently., But even if the Indians had believed that they had a compensable interest in the Executive Order lands, this fact would not necessarily have given it to them., Certainly the absence of presidential authority to give them a compensable title could not be supplied by the Indians' understanding that the President had such authority., The Sioux Indians may also have thought the President had authority to convey title to them; but the reasons on which our decision in the Sioux case, supra, rested do not indicate that our holding depended in any way upon the understanding of the Indians., Nor can this alleged understanding be imputed to Congress in the face of plain language and a rather full legislative history indicating that the 1880 Act neither conveyed nor ratified conveyance of these lands., While it has long been the rule that a treaty with Indians is to be construed so as to carry out the Government's obligations in accordance with the fair understanding of the Indians, we cannot, under the guise of interpretation, create Presidential authority where there was none, nor rewrite congressional acts so as to make them mean something they obviously were not intended to mean., Choctaw Nation of Indians v. United [330 U.S. 169, 180] States, 318 U.S. 423, 431 , 432 S., 63 S.Ct. 672, 677, 678., We cannot, under any acceptable rule of interpretation, hold that the Indians owned the lands merely because they thought so., Solicitous as the Government is to carry out its promises to the Indians in good faith, we are satisfied from this record that the Government has performed all that it promised., As we have pointed out, it seems obvious to us from the findings of the Court of Claims that the Executive Order was only intended to secure for these Indians' ancestors possession of the White River Valley lands conveyed to them by the original 1868 treaty, and which was jeopardized by the Miller survey., 5 In fact, the President had no authority to convey a compensable interest in these or other lands to the Utes. Fairly to carry out the 1868 treaty was the order's aim., The 1880 Act, we believe, did not enlarge upon the limited purpose of the Executive Order., To compensate these Indians for lands, not intended to be conveyed by the 1868 treaty, the Executive Order, nor the 1880 Act, would be to pay them for lands which neither they nor their ancestors ever owned and to which they had no claim in equity or justice, so far as the transactions here at issue are concerned., No rule of construction justifies such a result., AFFIRMED., Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting., The United States, in my opinion, is morally and legally obligated to pay for the land in issue in this case., The Executive Order of 1875 by its terms set aside certain land up to the 'first standard parallel north' for the use of the Ute Indians 'as an addition to their present reservation.', That order alone, of course, could convey no compensable interest to the Indians under the rule of Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, 316 U.S. 317 , 62 S.Ct. 1095., But events subsequent to [330 U.S. 169, 181] the issuance of the Executive Order in this case make inapplicable the principle of the Sioux case., In 1880 the United States and the Ute chiefs and headmen entered into an agreement whereby the latter promised 'to use their best endeavors with their people to procure their consent to cede to the United States all the territory of the present Ute Rese vation in Colorado.', Congress thereupon passed the Act of June 15, 1880, which recited in its preamble that the chiefs and headmen had 'submitted to the Secretary of the Interior an agreement for the sale to the United States of their present reservation in the State of Colorado.', The Act then incorporated the agreement previously made and provided that all unallotted lands should be deemed to be released and conveyed to the United States., ...]</td>\n",

BULLINGTON(1947)\\nNo. 31\\nArgued: Decided: February 17, 1947\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 184]\\n \\n Mr. George Lyle Jones, of Asheville, N.C., for petitioner.\\n Mr. R. Roy Rush, of Roanoke, Va., for respondent.\\n\\n R. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n In 1940, Bullington, a citizen of Virginia, sold land in Virginia to Angel, a citizen of North Carolina. Only part of the purchase price was paid. For the balance, Angel executed a series of notes secured by a deed of trust on the land. Upon default on one of the notes, Bullington acting upon an acceleration clause in the deed, caused all other notes to become due and called upon the trus- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 185]\\n \\n tees to sell the land. The sale was duly made in Virginia and the proceeds of the sale applied to the payment of the notes. This controversy concerns attempts to collect the deficiency.\\n Bullington began suit for the deficiency in the Superior Court of Macon County, North Carolina. Angel countered with a demurrer, the substance of which was that a statute of North Carolina (c. 36, Public Laws 1933, Mitchie's Code  2593(f)) precluded recovery of such a deficiency judgment. This is the relevant portion of that enactment:\\n'In all sales of real property by mortgagees and/or trustees under powers of sale contained in any mortgage or deed of trust hereafter executed, ... the mortgagee or trustee or holder of the notes secured by such mortgage or deed of trust shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account of such mortgage, deed of trust or obligation secured by the same: ...'.\\n\\n The Superior Court overruled the demurrer, and an appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina followd. Bullington supported his Superior Court judgment on the ground that the United States Constitution precluded North Carolina from shutting the doors of its courts to him. The North Carolina Supreme Court, holding that the North Carolina Act of 1933 barred Bullington's suit against Angel, reversed the Superior Court and dismissed the action. 220 N.C. 18, 16 S.E.2d 411, 136 A.L.R. 1054. Bullington did not seek to review this judgment here. Instead, he sued Angel for the deficiency in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. Angel pleaded in bar the judgment in the North Carolina action. The District Court, 56 F.Supp. 372, gave judgment for Bullington and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 150 F.2d 679. We granted certiorari, \\n326 \\nU.S. 713\\n, 66 S.Ct. 231, because the failure \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 186]\\n \\n to dismiss this action, on the ground that the judgment in the North Carolina court precluded the right thereafter to recover on the same cause of action in the federal court, presented an important question in the administration of justice.\\n\\n 1. \\nWe start with the fact that the prevailing rule as to res judicata is settled law in North Carolina. An adjudication bars future litigation between the same parties not only as to all issues actually raised and decided but also as to those which could have been raised. Southern Distributing Co. v. Carraway, 196 N.C. 58, 60, 61, 144 S.E. 535; Moore v. Harkins, 179 N.C. 167, 101 S.E. 564. When the disposition of a prior litigation is invoked as a bar to an action, the identity of the causes of action in the two suits is usually the bone of contention. On this score there can here be no controversy. It is indisputable that the parties, the nature of the claim and the desired relief were precisely the same in the two actions successively brought by Bullington against Angel, first in the Superior Court of Macon County and then in the federal district court. For all practical purposes, the complaint in the present action was a carbon copy of the complaint in the State court action. If the North Carolina action had been dismissed because it was brought in one North Carolina court rather than in another, of course no federal issue would have been involved. See, e.g., Woods v. Nierstheimer, \\n328 \\nU.S. 211\\n, 66 S.Ct. 996. Had that been the case, a suit for the same cause of action could have been initiated in a North Carolina federal district court, just as another suit could have been brought in the proper North Carolina State court. But that is not the present situation. A quite different situation is before us. Being somewhat unusual, it calls for a critical consideration of the scope and purpose of the doctrine of res judicata.\\n\\n 2. \\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina would clearly bar this suit had it been brought anew \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 187]\\n \\n in a state court. For purp ses of diversity jurisdiction a federal court is 'in effect, only another court of the State'. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \\n326 \\nU.S. 99, 108\\n, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 1469, 160 A.L.R. 1231; see Madisonville Traction Company v. Saint Bernard Mining Company, \\n196 \\nU.S. 239, 253\\n, 25 S.Ct. 251, 256; Ex parte Schollenberger, \\n96 \\nU.S. 369\\n, 377. Of course, Bullington could not have succeeded in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina after an adverse judgment in the State courts, had the decision in this case involved no federal ground. That is equally true where a federal question was decided in the State courts. That the adjudication of federal questions by the North Carolina Supreme Court may have been erroneous is immaterial for purposes of res judicata. Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, \\n274 \\nU.S. 316, 325\\n, 47 S.Ct. 600, 604. A higher court was available for an authoritative adjudication of the federal questions involved. And so the question is whether federal rights were necessarily involved and adjudicated in the litigation in the State courts.\\n\\n 3. \\nFor purposes of res judicata, the significance of what a court says it decides is controlled by the issues that were open for decision. What were the issues in the North Carolina litigation? Bullington sought a deficiency judgment. Angel, by demurrer, resisted on the ground that a North Carolina statute precluded a deficiency judgment. The North Carolina Supreme Court, reversing the trial court, found the North Carolina statute a bar to such a suit. It said that\\n'the limitation created by the statute is upon the jurisdiction of the court in that it is declared that the holder of notes given to secure the purchase price of real property 'shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account' thereof. This closes the courts of this state to one who seeks a deficiency judgment on a note given for the purchase price of real property. The statute operates upon the adjective law of the state, which pertains to the practice and procedure, \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 188]\\n \\n or legal machinery by which the substantive law is made effective, and not upon the substantive law itself. It is a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.' 220 N.C. 18, 20, 16 S.E.2d 411, 412, 136 A.L.R. 1054\\n\\n\\n\\n But the allowable 'limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts' of North Carolina presents more than a question of local law for determination by the North Carolina Supreme Court. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice Brandeis thus expressed the subordination to the requirements of the Constitution of the power of a State to withdraw jurisdiction from its courts: 'The power of a state to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them is, of course, subject to the restrictions imposed by the Federal Constitution.' McKnett v. St. Louis &amp; S.F.R. Co., \\n292 \\nU.S. 230, 233\\n, 54 S.Ct. 690, 691. The Contract Clause, U.S.Const. Art. 1,  10, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S.Const. art. 4,  1, the Privileges or Immunities Clause, U.S.Const. art. 4,  2, all fetter the freedom of a State to deny access to its courts howsoever much it may regard such withdrawal of jurisdiction 'the adjective law of the State', or the exercise of its right to regulate 'the practice and procedure' of its courts. Broderick v. Rosner, \\n294 \\nU.S. 629, 642\\n, 55 S.Ct. 589, 592, 100 A.L.R. 1133. A State 'cannot escape its constitutional obligations by the simple device of denying jurisdiction in such cases to Courts otherwise competent.' Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \\n252 \\nU.S. 411, 415\\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 372, 10 A.L. R. 716; and see White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646. This pervasive principle of our federal law, constitutional and statutory, was thus put by Mr. Justice Holmes: 'Whatever springes the State may set for those who are endeavoring to assert rights that the State confers, the assertion of Federal rights, w en plainly and reasonably made, is not to be defeated under the name of local practice.' Davis v. Wechsler, \\n263 \\nU.S. 22, 24\\n, 44 S.Ct. 13, 14.\\n\\n 4. \\nHere, claims based on the United States Constitution were plainly and reasonably made in the North Caro- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 189]\\n \\n lina suit. The North Carolina Supreme Court met these claims. It met them by saying that the North Carolina statute did not deal with substantive matters but merely with matters regulating local procedure. But whether the claims are based on a federal right or are merely of local concern is itself a federal question on which this Court, and not the Supreme Court of North Carolina, has the last say. That Court could not put a federal claim aside, as though it were not in litigation, by the talismanic word 'jurisdiction'. When an asserted federal right is denied, the sufficiency of the grounds of denial is for this Court to decide. Titus v. Wallick, \\n306 \\nU.S. 282, 291\\n, 59 S.Ct. 557, 562. Bullington could have come here, not merely by the grace of this Court on certiorari, but on appeal, as did White in White v. Hart, supra, to challenge, successfully, the right of Georgia to limit the jurisdiction of the Georgia courts; as did the East New York Savings Bank in the recent case of East New York Sav. Bank v. Hahn, \\n326 \\nU.S. 230\\n, 66 S.Ct. 69, 160 A.L.R. 1279, to challenge, though unsuccessfully, the limitation which New York placed upon the jurisdiction of its courts. Cf. Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \\n252 \\nU.S. 411, 416\\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 372, 10 A.L.R. 716. Since it was open for Bullington to come here to seek reversal of the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court shutting him out of the North Carolina courts and he chose not to do so, the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded an adjudication of a federal question even though it was not couched in those terms. For purposes of litigating the issues in controversy in the North Carolina action, the North Carolina Supreme Court was an intermediate tribunal. If a litigant chooses not to continue to assert his rights after an intermediate tribunal has decided against him, he has concluded his litigation as effectively as though he had proceeded through the highest tribunal available to him. An adjudication of an issue implies that a man had a chance to win his case. The chance was necessarily afforded by the North Carolina litigation. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 190]\\n \\n It was in process of determination when the Supreme Court of North Carolina decided against him. He forewent his right to have a higher court, this Court, enable him to win his chance by holding that he was right and that the North Carolina Supreme Court was wrong. He cannot begin all over again in an action involving the same issues before another forum in the same State.\\n\\n 5. \\nIt is suggested that the North Carolina Supreme Court did not adjudicate the 'merits' of the controversy. It is a misconception of res judicata to assume that the doctrine does not come into operation if a court has not passed on the 'merits' in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation. An adjudication declining to reach such ultimate substantive issues may bar a second attempt to reach them in another court of the State. Such a situation is presented when the first decision is based not on the ground that the distribution of judicial power among the various courts of the State requires the suit to be brought in another court in the State, but on the inaccessibility of all the courts of the State to such litigation. And that is the essence of the present case. The only issue in controversy in the first North Carolina litigation was whether or not all the courts of North Carolina were closed to that litigation. The merits of that issue were adjudicated. And that was the issue raised in the second litigation in North Carolina-that in the federal district court. The merits of this issue having been adjudicated, they cannot be relitigated.\\n The 'merits' of a claim are disposed of when hey are refused enforcement. If an asserted federal claim is denied enforcement on a professed local ground, but a so-called local ground which is subject to review here because it is in fact the adjudication of a federal question, then the 'merits' of that claim were adjudicated in the only sense that adjudication of the 'merits' is relevant to the principles of res judicata. A State court can- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 191]\\n \\n not sterilize federal claims by putting on the adjudication a locl label.\\n\\n 6. \\nThe merits of this controversy were adjudicated by the North Carolina Supreme Court since that court, or this Court on appeal, might have decided that the North Carolina statute did not bar Bullington's first action. The North Carolina statute might have been found unconstitutional. Federal issues were thus involved in the adjudication by the North Carolina Supreme Court. Bullington knew that there were federal issues in the State suit because he raised them. He was then content to drop them and let the intermediate adjudication stand. Now he wants an encore.\\n\\n 7. \\nIt is suggested that the North Carolina Supreme Court construed the North Carolina statute to close only the North Carolina State courts but not the federal court sitting in North Carolina. In the first place, the North Carolina Supreme Court said no such thing. It construed the statute expressive of State policy and spoke only of the jurisdiction of the State courts because it was concerned only with the State courts. Secondly, it is most incongruous to attribute to the legislature and judiciary of North Carolina the imposition of a restriction against all its citizens from suing for a deficiency judgment, while impliedly authorizing citizens of other States to secure such deficiency judgments against North Carolinians. Thirdly, a North Carolina statute, upheld by the highest court of North Carolina, is of course expressive of North Carolina policy. The essence of diversity jurisdiction is that a federal court enforces State law and State policy. If North Carolina has authoritatively announced that deficiency judgments cannot be secured within its borders, it contradicts the presuppositions of diversity jurisdiction for a federal court in that State to give such a deficiency judgment. North Carolina would hardly allow defeat of a State-wide policy through occasional suits in a federal \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 192]\\n \\n court. What is more important, diversity jurisdiction must follow State law and policy. A federal court in North Carolina, when invoked on grounds of diversity of citizenship, cannot give that which North Carolina has withheld. Availability of diversity jurisdiction which was put into the Constitution so as to prevent discrimination against outsiders is not to effect discrimination against the great body of local citizens.\\n Cases like David Lupton's Sons v. Automobile Club of America, \\n225 \\nU.S. 489\\n, 32 S.Ct. 711, Ann.Cas.1914A, 699, are obsolete insofar as they are based on a view of diversity jurisdiction which came to an end with Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \\n304 \\nU.S. 64\\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487. That decision drastically limited the power of federal district courts to entertain suits in diversity cases that could not be brought in the respective State courts or were barred by defenses controlling in the State courts. Compare Suydam v. Broadnax, 14 Pet. 67, 75. Of course, where resort is had to a federal court not on grounds of diversity of citizenship but because a federal right is claimed, the limitations upon the courts of a State do not control a federal court sitting in the State. Holmberg v. Armbrecht, \\n327 \\nU.S. 392\\n, 66 S.Ct. 582, 162 A.L.R. 719.\\n\\n 8. \\nAfter an adverse decision against Bullington on a cause of action created by State law, Bullington wants to start all over again in another North Carolina court, albeit a federal court. The first litigation raised and adjudicated federal issues every one of which is again involved in the second suit. To allow such a second suit i to say that a federal right in issue in a State court evaporates because the State court calls it a State right and the litigant accepts the decision. If tolerated, our federal system would afford fine opportunities for needlessly multiplying litigation in this way. The doctrine of res judicata is a barrier against it. Litigation is the means for vindicating rights, but it may also involve unwarranted friction and waste. The doctrine of res judicata reflects the refusal of law to toler- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 193]\\n \\n ate needless litigation. Litigation is needless if, by fair process, a controversy has once gone through the courts to conclusion. Compare, e.g., Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford Empire Co., \\n322 \\nU.S. 238, 244\\n, 64 S.Ct. 997, 1000. And it has gone through, if issues that were or could have been dealt with in an earlier litigation are raised anew between the same parties. Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, \\n308 \\nU.S. 371\\n, 60 S.Ct. 317.\\n Judgment reversed.\\n\\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\\n My understanding of the Court's decision is that the doctrine of res judicata, that is a former adjudication, defeats Bullington's claim against Angel. The opinion is limited to that point. In my view the conclusion reached by the Court is erroneous. To narrow the line of my disagreement, I shall state the issues treated in the opinion with which I agree. The causes of action and the parties in the two suits are identical. Federal questions were raised by Bullington's contention that the North Carolina statute, sufficiently quoted at the beginning of the Court's opinion, Mitchie's Code, 2593(f), was unconstitutional by federal tests because it barred the North Carolina courts to Bullington's suit on his notes. It is immaterial, for the purposes of determining the availability of a plea of res judicata, whether the North Carolina judgment was erroneous or not. I agree, further, that, on the ground that a state cannot bar this cause of action from its courts, Bullington could have had review in this Court of the North Carolina judgment and that this Court, if it did not conclude that the North Carolina judgment rested on an adequate state ground, could have finally settled that federal constitutional issue.\\n The reasoning of the Court leads to the announced result because of these presuppositions with which I differ: (I) 'For purposes of res judicata, the significance of what a court says it decides is controlled by the issues that \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 194]\\n \\n were open for decision.' (II) 'The 'merits' of a claim are disposed of when they are refused enforcement.' (III) 'Since it was open for Bullington to come here to seek reversal of the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court shutting him out of the North Carolina courts and he chose not to do so, the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded an adjudication of a federal question even though it was not couched in those terms.' (IV) 'For purposes of diversity jurisdiction of federal court is 'in effect, only another court of the State.\" 'He cannot begin all over again in an action involving the same issues before another forum in the same State.'\\n I. To say that for purposes of res judicata the significance of what a court says it decides is controlled by the issues, announces a rule which, so far as I know, has no prior authority. To adopt such a rule is to declare that a decision in a cause of action is final between the same parties although the court specifically reserves certain questions not necessary for its decision. Res judicata settles all questions which were raised or those that might have been raised but it settles them in accordance with the decision that is made. Of course, when a decision is upon the merits, a matter discussed later, the entire cause of action is adjudicated finally. But this North Carolina adjudication was not upon the merits. It was upon a question of judicial power. The pertinent excerpts from the opinion appear below. \\n1\\n The fact that other \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 195]\\n \\n issues, going to the merits of the cause of action, might have been decided seems immaterial.\\n The rule which I consider sound appears in the Restatement of the Law, Judgments  49, as follows:\\n'Where a valid and final personal judgment not on the merits is rendered in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff is not thereby precluded from thereafter maintaining an action on the original cause of action and the judgment is conclusive only as to what is actually decided.'\\n\\n The way to know what was actually decided in this case is to read the applicable portion of the opinion printed in the preceding note. The result of the decision was to leave the cause of action unaffected because when a state denies a remedy, it leaves 'unimpaired the plaintiff's substantive right, so that he is free to enforce it elsewhere.' Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \\n286 \\nU.S. 145, 160\\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 576, 82 A.L.R. 696; Dalton v. Webster, 82 N.C. 279. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 196]\\n \\n II. It is now to be considered whether or not this judgment of the state court was on the merits. That court said it had no 'power to render a judgment for the plaintiff in the cause of action alleged.' This Court now says that such a decision is a disposition on the merits. Eviently what is meant is that when a litigant, who has raised a federal constitutional question, has his case dismissed on the ground that the court 'has no power to render a judgment for the plaintiff in the cause of action alleged,' there is a judgment on the merits on the constitutional question as well as upon the right to recover in North Carolina on any other ground. If we have power to declare that it 'concluded an adjudication of a federal question even though it professed not to do so,' I would reach the opposite conclusion based upon what the North Carolina court did. In my view, the North Carolina court merely decided that it had no power to adjudicate the cause of action. Certainly the state court had the power to interpret its own statute. Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Meyer, \\n265 \\nU.S. 30, 32\\n, 44 S.Ct. 432, 433; Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, \\n315 \\nU.S. 568\\n, 62 S.Ct. 766. The withdrawal of jurisdiction surely does not make a judgment one upon the merits. The state court cited x parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, to emphasize what it meant. If there was a suit on this note in a federal court on an allegation of diversity of citizenship and the federal court dismissed the suit with an opinion saying that the case was dismissed because of lack of jurisdiction, e.g. proof of non-diversity of citizenship, no state court would hold that there had been a decision upon the merits. Where there is no jurisdiction of the subject of the action the judgment is not upon the merits. Stoll v. Gottlieb, \\n305 \\nU.S. 165, 171\\n, 172 S., 59 S.Ct. 134, 137, 138. Of course, if there is a judgment upon the merits, that judgment would be binding on both federal and state courts. Even if the North Carolina decision is not upon the merits, it is conclusive on North Carolina courts and upon federal courts in North Carolina, \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 197]\\n \\n if those federal courts are courts of the State of North Carolina in the sense that they must follow state decisions upon the power of state courts, under the rule of Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \\n326 \\nU.S. 99\\n, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 160 A.L.R. 1231. I do not think that the guaranty rule applies. See subdivision IV.\\n III. If the two preceding numbered divisions of this opinion are sound, there was no occasion for Bullington to seek a review of the first judgment in this Court. He was in the position of the owner of a cause of action, dismissed because prematurely brought or brought in the wrong county. The judgment that the Supreme Court of North Carolina ordered was 'dismissed' not on the merits, not with prejudice, and not judgment for the defendant, but a simple dismissal. North Carolina might have declared, by statute, that no cause of action would be recognized in North Carolina for the recovery of a deficiency on a mortgage indebtedness. Instead of this, we are told, authoritatively, by the Supreme Court of North Carolina that North Carolina has withdrawn the jurisdiction of its courts from such a cause of action. This produces quite a different situation.\\n IV. The pith of the problem, as I see it, is laid bare by the foregoing differentiations. It consists of the question whether the North Carolina decision establishes a controlling rule of law upon the constitutionality of the state statute as tested by the federal Constitution or adjudicates that the statute merely withdraws jurisdiction from state courts over a type of action. This Court concludes that the state decision determined the constitutionality of the statute and that its holding was binding on all federal courts in North Carolina, as well as state courts. This idea is comprehended in the Court's opinion by the statements that the federal courts are courts of the state in diversity cases and that a litigant cannot stop with an intermediate court decision against him and begin a new litigation on the same cause of action. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 198]\\n \\n The Court reaches the conclusion that res judicata should apply by an application of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \\n304 \\nU.S. 64\\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, and Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \\n326 \\nU.S. 99\\n, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 160 A.L.R. 1231. The teaching of those cases is accepted by me. They lead to the conclusion that in diversity cases, legal or equitable, and this proceeding is a diversity case, the federal courts in a state apply the law of that state in matters of substantive law. In matters of procedure and jurisdiction, I take it, no one would contend that the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins is applicable. One may regret that the line of the Great Divide between substance and procedure cannot be clearly marked so that all may agree as to its location in any one case. But that line exists. We have said that federal courts must follow the law of the state as to burden of proof. Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, \\n308 \\nU.S. 208\\n, 60 S.Ct. 201; Palmer v. Hoffman, \\n318 \\nU.S. 109, 117\\n, 63 S.Ct. 477, 482, 144 A.L.R. 719; as to conflict of laws, Griffin v. McCoach \\n313 \\nU.S. 498\\n, 61 S. Ct. 1023, 134 A.L.R. 1462; Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., \\n313 \\nU.S. 487\\n, 61 S.Ct. 1020, and as to state statutes of limitation in equity cases, Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra. The reason for these conclusions is to gain the desirable end of a symmetry of law within each state. The momentum of the opinions, just cited, and of the desire for unifrmity should not cause us to disregard the rule that state law, statutory or judicial, directed at remedies or powers of courts, cannot affect the federal system. Each of the cases just cited follows the declarations of state law by state courts. In this case, this Court departs from the state court's interpretation of the meaning of a state statute in order to bring about the federal policy of uniformity. By this, the Court departs from the sound rule that a state court's interpretation of state statutes is binding on federal courts. In reaching the conclusion which it does, this Court decides that if a state court does not have power to adjudicate a cause, neither does a federal court in that state. It also departs from controlling precedents that state enactments on jurisdic- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 199]\\n \\n tion, remedies and procedures do not affect the jurisdiction, remedies or procedures of federal courts. It is true that these antedate the Erie case but that case did not change the state and federal jurisdiction.\\n In Pusey &amp; Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \\n261 \\nU.S. 491\\n, 43 S.Ct. 454, 456, this Court held that an authority given by Delaware to its Chancellor to appoint a receiver for an insolvent corporation on the application of any creditor did not give additional power to the federal court to appoint a receiver in a diversity case on the application of a simple creditor although the federal courts had long exercised the right to appoint receivers on the application of a secured creditor. This Court said:\\n'That a remedial right to proceed in a federal court sitting in equity cannot be enlarged by a state statute is likewise clear, Scott v. Neely, \\n140 \\nU.S. 106\\n, 11 S.Ct. 712; Cates v. Allen, \\n149 \\nU.S. 451\\n, 13 S.Ct. 883, 977. Nor can it be so narrowed. Mississippi Mills v. Cohn, \\n150 \\nU.S. 202\\n, 14 S.Ct. 75; Guffey v. Smith, \\n237 \\nU.S. 101, 114\\n, 35 S.Ct. 526, (530,) 59 L.Ed. 856. The federal court may therefore be obliged to deny an equitable remedy which the plaintiff might have secured in a state court. Hanssen's contention is that the statute does not enlarge the equitable jurisdiction or remedies, and that it confers upon creditors of a Delaware corporation, if the company is insolvent, a substantive equitable right to have a receiver appointed. If this were true the right conferred could be enforced in the federal courts (Scott v. Neely, \\n140 \\nU.S. 106, 109\\n, 11 S.Ct. 712, (713,) 35 L.Ed. 358), since the proceeding is in pleading and practice conformable to those commonly entertained by a court of equity. But it is not true that this statute confers upon the creditor a substantive right.'\\n\\n See Henrietta Mills v. Rutherford County, \\n291 \\nU.S. 121, 127\\n, 128 S., 50 S.Ct. 270, 272, 273; Kelleam v. Maryland Casualty Co., \\n312 \\nU.S. 377, 382\\n, 61 S.Ct. 595, 598. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 200]\\n \\n In David Lupton's Sons v. Automobile Club of America, \\n225 \\nU.S. 489\\n, 32 S.Ct. 711, Ann.Cas.1914A, 699, this Court held, that a contract which could not be sued upon in the courts of New York because a New York statute provided that no foreign corporation could 'maintain any action in this state' without a certificate that it had complied with certain state requirements to do business in the state, could nevertheless be sued upon in the federal court. It was said, 225 U.S. at page 500, 32 S. Ct. at page 714:\\n'The state could not prescribe the qualifications of suitors in the courts of the United States, and could not deprive of their privileges those who were entitled under the Constitution and laws of the United States to resort to the Fede al courts for the enforcement of a valid contract. ... The state in the statute before us made no such attempt. The only penalty is imposed, to quote again from the Mahar Case (Mahar v. Harrington Park Villa Sites, 204 N.Y. 231, 97 N.E. 587, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 210), was a disability to sue 'in the courts of New York.\"\\n\\n These cases make clear that in diversity litigation the federal courts are not simply courts of the state. They are so far as the enforcement of the substantive laws of the state are concerned, but not when procedure or power to act is involved. The Lupton case shows too, that when a state denies power to its courts to adjudicate a cause, that denial does not affect the power of the federal courts to decide the case. As I am of the opinion that the state court merely denied its power to adjudge between these parties and did not decide the merits of Bullington's cause of action, the state court judgment cannot be res judicata in the federal court.\\n If it is true that in passing upon the meaning of a state statute, a federal court is not required to follow the state court's characterization of its statute, as remedial or substantive, this Court's present determination that the statute is substantive for our purposes cannot change the effect in this litigation of the state's decision to the contrary. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 201]\\n \\n When the state court held that for its purposes the statute was remedial, it was remedial in that court. If remedial, the state judgment was not upon the merits and could not be res judicata in any court as to the right to recover on the cause of action.\\n If the plea of res judicata is not good and this Court should decide that the state statute is substantive law, i.e., a declaration of the policy of North Carolina against claims on deficiencies after sales of incumbered property, it would be necessary to determine the constitutionality of the North Carolina statute that declares uncollectible in North Carolina a claim on a contract that was good in Virginia. In view of this Court's present decision, I express no opinion upon this issue.\\n Mr. Justice JACKSON and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE join in this opinion.\\n\\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE, dissenting.\\n This is a hard case making, I think, proverbially bad law. On the surface what seems to be decided is simply a question of res judicata. Actually the decision rests on an 'and/or' hodgepodge of res judicata and Erie doctrines. 1 In my judgment the admixture not only is unnecessary but distorts and misapplies both doctrines. If res judicata properly applies and is adequate to dispose of the cause, there is no occasion for the sidewise introduction of Erie ideas. Likewise, if Erie appropriately governs the case, the Court's elaborate and altogether novel discussion of res judicata is superfluous.\\n The Court has not decided this case on any basis of full faith and credit. 2 Accordingly res judicata as it is applied \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 202]\\n \\n has neither constitutional nor statutory status. For present purposes it is therefore purely a rule of judicial administration to be applied, like all such rules, as considerations of justice and right application of the policy require, not omitting due regard for its appropriate limits.\\n Res judicata is a generally sound but by no means unlimited policy of judicial action. The doctrine is grounded in the need for putting an end to litigation. 3 It does this by precluding the parties from showing what is or may be the truth. \\n4\\n The sound core of the policy is that ordinarily one suit which determines or gives a full and fair chance \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 203]\\n \\n for determining causes of action and issues5 between litigants should be enough and when this much has been given further opportunity should be denied.\\n Stated so simply, however, the doctrine would be as much trap for the unwary as boon for the wise or lucky litigant. Exceptions and qualifications are so numerous as to make the field not only technical but treacherous, this case being a nice illustration. Qualification may itself lose sight of basic policy and become sheer technicality. \\n6\\n But general rules are not qualified so extensively as this one has been without reason. There is good reason for much of what has been done in this respect with res judicata.\\n The effect of the rule qualifies its scope. It is not every case in which a litigant has had 'one bite at the cherry' that the law forbids another. In other words, it is not every such case in which the policy of stopping litigation outweighs that of showing the truth. This is so not only where the first suit actually gives no real chance to secure a substantial determination, 7 but also though less generally of others in which the litigant has such a chance and foregoes or misses it. \\n8\\n It is so too whether the claimed \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 204]\\n \\n estoppel by prior suit is 'direct' or 'indirect,' that is, on the same or a different cause of action. \\n9\\n \\n\\n Upon the law as well as the policy, the question has been one of balancing considerations of justice and convenience between stopping litigation and stopping the showing of the truth. \\n10\\n That balance has never been so one-sided in favor of the former that the matter is ended simply by showing that a party has had some chance, however slight, in a previous litigation to secure a favorable decision.\\n If this were the law every case where a party takes a nonsuit or a dismissal expressly for the purpose of starting over again would be a final and conclusive determination against him. I know of no jurisdiction where the law has been so harsh. Nor do I think it should be in this one.\\n There are too many good reasons why persons starting out in litigation should not be barred of their rights by the fact alone that they withdraw in order to start again, even though by going on to the end they might pull through successfully against great odds. Crucial witnesses may disappear or die and time be required for finding them or others. Surprise in the course of trial may occur justifying withdrawal without fatal loss of rights. Even as in \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 205]\\n \\n this case, jurisdictional and other uncertainties may arise putting in jeopardy or making comparatively or completely futile further pursuit of the pending litigation when another suit in the same or a different court might provide a more certain and less expensive mode of disposing of the controversy for all the parties.\\n These and other reasons have qualified flat application of res judicata too long and too universally for their qualifying effects to be thrown overboard now simply because a withdrawing litigant might conceivably have come out victorious had he gone on to the very farthest end. \\n11\\n Such a criterion would turn res judicata into a rigid rule requiring exhaustion of judicial remedies, a notion heretofore wholly alien to the doctrine. \\n12\\n \\n\\n This course, moreover, seems to be justified on the basis that the grounds of an adjudication have nothing to do with the adjudication or its effects for purposes of applying res judicata. That is true, apparently, for applying res judicata to Bullington's failure to take his appeal here in the North Carolina state court suit, so as to cut off his right ever to secure a decision on the \"merits' in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation.' But it is not true apparently, for application of the doctrine to different jurisdictional rulings. For 'an adjudication declining to reach such ultimate substantive issues may bar a second attempt to reach them in another court of the \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 206]\\n \\n State. Such a situation is presented when the first decision is based not on the ground that the distribution of judicial power among the various courts of the State requires the suit to be brought in another court in the State, but on the inaccessibility of all the courts of the State to such litigation. And that is the essence of the present case.' (Emphasis added.)\\n I can understand the distinction drawn. But I find difficulty in understanding why res judicata turns for application in this case to cut off determination of substantive issues not at all upon the grounds of decision but only on the fact of adverse decision; but, for application to such issues when a jurisdictional question is also involved, it turns not simply upon the adjudication, but upon the grounds for the jurisdictional determination. If res judicata is governed solely by the adjudication without reference to what is adjudicated, that is, merely by the fact of adverse decision, I should think that rule would apply in all cases. If, on the contrary, the grounds of adjudication are relevant and controlling for the one class of questions, I should think they would be for the other.\\n The fallacy lies in the novel and unprecedented idea that the groundings of a court's decision have nothing to do with whether res judicata applies, except when they relate to one kind of jurisdictional determination rather than another. Apart from the exception, the idea ignores the vast body of law which has grown up on the basis that the grounding of the decision is the criterion for applying the doctrine. \\n13\\n And much of that case law has been that if the \"merits' in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation' are not reached, their later determination is not foreclosed. \\n14\\n This is true whether or not the jurisdic- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 207]\\n \\n tional ruling is erroneous or valid and whether or not if erroneous it might have been corrected on appeal.\\n That law I think is sound, and I think it is just as sound when the jurisdictional decision goes off erroneously on a federal ground or erroneously ignoring one as when it rests on a valid basis. It is grounded in the policy that unless a litigant gets a real bite at the apple of discord he should not be foreclosed from another attempt. Its basis is that in such a case it is better and more just not to stop litigation than it is to stop the showing of the truth and thereby bring about a forfeiture of valuable substantive rights without giving at least one full and fair, which means fairly certain, opportunity for securing decision upon them.\\n Bullington has not had such an opportunity. He has never received, and now never can receive a decision on the substantive merits of his claim, unless possibly he can catch and serve Angel in another state and after prolonged further litigation succeed in inducing this Court to hold the North Carolina bar and res judicata not operative there. See Riley v. New York Trust Co., \\n315 \\nU.S. 343, 349\\n, 62 S.Ct. 608, 612: 'By the Constitutional provision for full faith and credit, the local doctrines of res judicata, speaking generally, become a part of national jurisprudence, and therefore federal questions cognizable here.'\\n Conceivably Bullington by coming here in the North Carolina suit might have secured a decision that the North Carolina statute and decision were invalid constitutionally in excluding him from all the state's courts and that the state must afford him a remedy on proof of his substantive claim. But the very multiplicity of the constitutional questions enumerated in the Court's opinion which were or might have been pertinent made that chance slim indeed. What is more important is that i the judgment had been thus reversed and remanded, it would have been \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 208]\\n \\n wiped out and he then would have been free to dismiss the suit and start over again in the federal courts sitting in the state or in the state courts. Bucher v. Cheshire R. Co., \\n125 \\nU.S. 555, 578\\n, 579 S., 8 S.Ct. 974, 975, 976.15\\n On the other hand, if the case had gone against him here, then his right to start over in the federal court in North Carolina would depend upon whether one of two grounds were accepted for this Court's decision, namely, on the one hand, that North Carolina had power to bar his substantive claim and had done so in effect though not in words, thus closing the doors of the federal court to it under the Erie rule; on the other, that the state had power to close its courts against his claim without adjudicating its substantive validity, thus leaving him free to go to the federal court under the Erie rule. Either result was a conceivable one, depending on whether the Court should conclude that a 'right without a remedy' remains a right, for this purpose, or becomes none at all. But the only chance for Bullington's ultimate success, in the event of adverse deci- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 209]\\n \\n sion here, would have been for the decision to have turned out on the latter ground.\\n That chance was hardly worth the gamble. For this Court has declared in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \\n326 \\nU.S. 99, 108\\n, 109 S., 65 S.Ct. 1464, 1469, 1470, 160 A.L.R. 1231, that a right without a remedy is no right at all for purposes of enforcement by a diversity suit in a federal court sitting in the state. \\n16\\n And the nature of the North Carolina statute as construed by the state court reaches exactly the result which the York case says precludes resort to the federal court on the same cause in a diversity suit. 17 Indeed this seems to be an alternative basis for the present decision. 18 Buillington's chance to get to the federal court on such a basis was therefore practically nil.\\n Should he now be barred because he did not take the extremely remote chance of securing a favorable decision, reversing the state court's judgment and forcing the state to hear his case on the merits? Not, I think, unless we can say he then would have been forced, if successful, to continue the litigation in the state courts and could not withdraw to start over in the North Carolina federal court. This we could not say unles we were to overrule the Bucher case, which Bullington had a right to assume we would not do. Why he should be barred from doing now, because he did not take his almost hopeless appeal, what he would have been at liberty to do if he had taken it successfully, I am not able to understand. No sound policy of ending litigation, conserving judicial time or litigants' rights or in any other respect can possibly be served by \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 210]\\n \\n such a ruling. \\n19\\n Moreover, the very difficulties in his way for securing a successful determination here, which would give him some certain remedy either in the state or in the federal courts, were sufficient reason, in my opinion, to justify his foregoing that dubious procedure and starting over again in the federal court.\\n The real trouble here is not with the law of res judicata, for that law has no valid application to these facts. It is that the doctrine is used as an escape from facing squarely the real question presented. This is whether North Carolina's decision made the Erie doctrine applicable. The Court's opinion does state expressly that the effect of the North Carolina decision was to create a policy of the state against the validity of all claims for deficiency judgments, and comes almost but not quite to saying this requires the case to go off on application of the York rule.\\n That issue is inescapable here. The Erie rule did not purport to change the law of federal jurisdiction in diversity cases, taking it out of the hands of Congress and the federal courts and putting it within the states' power to determine. It purported only to prescribe the rule federal courts should follow in applying the substantive law. If the North Carolina decision was exclusively a jurisdic- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 211]\\n \\n tional one, it had no effect on the power of the federal courts in that state to hear controversies excluded by it from the state courts, and the decision neither reached the merits of the controversy 'in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation' nor barred Bullington from going to the federal court. See David Lupton's Sons v. Automobile Club, \\n225 \\nU.S. 489\\n, 32 S.Ct. 711, Ann.Cas.1914A 699. If on the other hand the decision was in effect, although not in words, a determination of the merits in that sense, if both adjudicated Bullington's substantive rights and barred him from maintaining the later suit successfully in the federal court. That question is here and until it is resolved he is deprived of any day in court except to go from one to another without securing decision either on the merits substantially or 'on the merits' jurisdictionally.\\n From the Court's opinion I cannot say whether the question has been resolved. Its discussion of North Carolina's 'policy' and its overruling of the Lupton's Sons case, supra, would seem to indicate that it is applying York, though without saying so frankly. But, if so, why speak also of res judicata? The law should not be made into such a merry-go- round. Bullington is entitled to one full day in court on the substance of his claim. This he has not had.\\n I hardly need add that I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Reed.\\n Mr. Justice JACKSON joins in this opinion. \\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] 220 N.C. at pages 20, 21, 16 S.E.2d at page 412, 136 A.L.R. 1054: 'The statute operates upon the adjective law of the state, which pertains to the practice and procedure, or legal machinery by which the substantive law is made effective, and not upon the substantive law itself. It is a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.\\n'The legislature, within constitutional limitations, can fix and circumscribe the jurisdiction of the courts of this state. The legislature has exercised its prerogative to so limit the jurisdiction of the courts of this state that holders of notes given for purchase price of real estate are not entitled to a deficiency judgment thereon in such courts. We cannot hold that this action upon part of the legislative branch of our government impinged the full faith and credit clause of the constitution of the United States, Art. 4,  1, or the general doctrine that the validity of a contract is determined by the law of the place where made, the lex loci contractus as distinguished from the lex fori. Both the constitutional provision urged and the general doctrine invoked by the appellee are substantive law and the statute involved, as aforesaid, relates solely to the adjective law. No denial of the full force and credit of the Virginia contract is made, and no interpretation or construction of the contract involved is attempted. The court, being deprived of its jurisdiction, has no power to render a judgment for the plaintiff in the cause of action alleged. 'Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.

IV,  1, binds the federal courts to give the North Carolina judgment the effect of precluding a further suit in the federal courts on the substantive cause of action. Two difficulties would arise. (1) If, as the Court asserts, the federal court in diversity cases were only 'another North Carolina court,' the full faith and credit clause would have no application; but, that it may, see Cooper v. Newell, \\n173 \\nU.S. 555, 567\\n, 19 S.Ct. 506, 510: '... the courts of the United States are tribunals of a different sovereignty, and exercise a distinct and independent jurisdiction from that exercised by the state courts; a d this is true in respect of the courts of the several States, as between each other. And the courts of the United States are bound to give to the judgments of the state courts the same faith and credit that the courts of one state and bound to give to the judgments of the courts of her sister states.' See also American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, \\n287 \\nU.S. 156\\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 86 A.L.R. 298, where Mr. Justice Brandeis spoke of the full faith and credit clause in connection with the obligation of a federal court sitting in Idaho to follow, as res judicata, a previous Idaho decision. (2) The decision would contradict, not confirm, as full faith and credit require, the basis for the North Carolina court's judgment, namely, that the statute does not outlaw substantive claims but only deprives the state courts of power to entertain them. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 3\\n] See Moschzisker, Res Judicata (1929) 38 Yale L.J. 299, 300. In this respect, of course, res judicata resembles both statutes of limitations and the doctrine of laches in equity, as well as full faith and credit when applicable to judgments. \\n[\\nFootnote 4\\n] Scott, Collateral Estoppel by Judgment (1942) 56 Harv.L.Rev. 1.

But the ruling as made, in so far as it rests on the failure to appeal ignores the settled law that for purposes of applying res judicata failure to take appeal has no bearing once the judgment becomes final. See note 19. It also defeats the policy of res judicata; for a party, instead of being allowed to accept the jurisdictional ruling, is forced to appeal to the highest court in order to save his rights no matter how meritless the appeal, thus prolonging rather than shortening litigation. \\n[\\nFootnote 12\\n] See note 19. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 13\\n] See Scott, op. cit., supra note 4; Restatement, Judgments (1942)  49, 50, 53, 54. \\n[\\nFootnote 14\\n] See authorities cited in note 7 supra. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 15\\n] 'If ... a judgment has been vacated by the trial court or reversed by an appellate court, it is no longer conclusive between the parties, either as a merger of the original cause of action or as a bar to an action upon the original cause of action. ...'

North Carolina follows both the doctrine that the trial court, upon remand by an appellate court, is to proceed as if there had been no previous trial and the doctrine that judgments not on the merits do not constitute an estoppel to subsequent actions.

Andrews, 170 N.C. at page 522, 87 S.E. at page 344. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 16\\n] The York case however did not purport to apply or extend the rule to a cause of action arising under and governed by the laws of another state than that in which the federal court was sitting. But cf. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., \\n313 \\nU.S. 487\\n, 61 S.Ct. 1020. \\n[\\nFootnote 17\\n] Except for the factor noted in Note 16. \\n[\\nFootnote 18\\n] See text infra. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 19\\n] 'The application of the principle of res judicata has not in any way been made to depend upon whether the judgment in question is subject to review in another tribunal. Except in so far as it may affect the question of its finality, as in the case of orders on motions, the fact that a judgment may or may not be appealable should have no bearing upon its effect as res judicata.' 2 Freeman, Judgments (5th ed.) 1339.\\n Thus, there is no doctrine of exhaustion of judicial remedies. If the judgment of a court goes on jurisdictional grounds, the party may accept it and, instead of appealing, may institute another action where he will not be met by the jurisdictional bar. Cf. Restatement, Judgments (1942) 194, 195; Cook, The Logical and Legal Bases of the Conflict of Laws (1942) 133-135. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>[United States Supreme Court ANGEL v. BULLINGTON(1947), No. 31 Argued: Decided: February 17, 1947 [330 U.S. 183, 184] Mr. George Lyle Jones, of Asheville, N.C., for petitioner., Mr. R. Roy Rush, of Roanoke, Va., for respondent., R. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court., In 1940, Bullington, a citizen of Virginia, sold land in Virginia to Angel, a citizen of North Carolina., Only part of the purchase price was paid., For the balance, Angel executed a series of notes secured by a deed of trust on the land., Upon default on one of the notes, Bullington acting upon an acceleration clause in the deed, caused all other notes to become due and called upon the trus- [330 U.S. 183, 185] tees to sell the land., The sale was duly made in Virginia and the proceeds of the sale applied to the payment of the notes., This controversy concerns attempts to collect the deficiency., Bullington began suit for the deficiency in the Superior Court of Macon County, North Carolina., Angel countered with a demurrer, the substance of which was that a statute of North Carolina (c. 36, Public Laws 1933, Mitchie's Code 2593(f)) precluded recovery of such a deficiency judgment., This is the relevant portion of that enactment: 'In all sales of real property by mortgagees and/or trustees under powers of sale contained in any mortgage or deed of trust hereafter executed, ..., the mortgagee or trustee or holder of the notes secured by such mortgage or deed of trust shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account of such mortgage, deed of trust or obligation secured by the same: ...'., The Superior Court overruled the demurrer, and an appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina followd., Bullington supported his Superior Court judgment on the ground that the United States Constitution precluded North Carolina from shutting the doors of its courts to him., The North Carolina Supreme Court, holding that the North Carolina Act of 1933 barred Bullington's suit against Angel, reversed the Superior Court and dismissed the action., 220 N.C. 18, 16 S.E.2d 411, 136 A.L.R. 1054., Bullington did not seek to review this judgment here., Instead, he sued Angel for the deficiency in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina., Angel pleaded in bar the judgment in the North Carolina action., The District Court, 56 F.Supp. 372, gave judgment for Bullington and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed., 150 F.2d 679., We granted certiorari, 326 U.S. 713 , 66 S.Ct. 231, because the failure [330 U.S. 183, 186] to dismiss this action, on the ground that the judgment in the North Carolina court precluded the right thereafter to recover on the same cause of action in the federal court, presented an important question in the administration of justice., 1., We start with the fact that the prevailing rule as to res judicata is settled law in North Carolina., An adjudication bars future litigation between the same parties not only as to all issues actually raised and decided but also as to those which could have been raised., Southern Distributing Co. v. Carraway, 196 N.C. 58, 60, 61, 144 S.E. 535; Moore v. Harkins, 179 N.C. 167, 101 S.E. 564., When the disposition of a prior litigation is invoked as a bar to an action, the identity of the causes of action in the two suits is usually the bone of contention., On this score there can here be no controversy., It is indisputable that the parties, the nature of the claim and the desired relief were precisely the same in the two actions successively brought by Bullington against Angel, first in the Superior Court of Macon County and then in the federal district court., For all practical purposes, the complaint in the present action was a carbon copy of the complaint in the State court action., If the North Carolina action had been dismissed because it was brought in one North Carolina court rather than in another, of course no federal issue would have been involved., See, e.g., Woods v. Nierstheimer, 328 U.S. 211 , 66 S.Ct. 996., Had that been the case, a suit for the same cause of action could have been initiated in a North Carolina federal district court, just as another suit could have been brought in the proper North Carolina State court., But that is not the present situation., A quite different situation is before us., Being somewhat unusual, it calls for a critical consideration of the scope and purpose of the doctrine of res judicata., 2., The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina would clearly bar this suit had it been brought anew [330 U.S. 183, 187] in a state court., For purp ses of diversity jurisdiction a federal court is 'in effect, only another court of the State'., Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 108 , 65 S.Ct. 1464, 1469, 160 A.L.R. 1231; see Madisonville Traction Company v. Saint Bernard Mining Company, 196 U.S. 239, 253 , 25 S.Ct. 251, 256; Ex parte Schollenberger, 96 U.S. 369 , 377., Of course, Bullington could not have succeeded in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina after an adverse judgment in the State courts, had the decision in this case involved no federal ground., That is equally true where a federal question was decided in the State courts., That the adjudication of federal questions by the North Carolina Supreme Court may have been erroneous is immaterial for purposes of res judicata., Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, 274 U.S. 316, 325 , 47 S.Ct. 600, 604., A higher court was available for an authoritative adjudication of the federal questions involved., And so the question is whether federal rights were necessarily involved and adjudicated in the litigation in the State courts. 3., For purposes of res judicata, the significance of what a court says it decides is controlled by the issues that were open for decision., What were the issues in the North Carolina litigation?, Bullington sought a deficiency judgment., Angel, by demurrer, resisted on the ground that a North Carolina statute precluded a deficiency judgment., The North Carolina Supreme Court, reversing the trial court, found the North Carolina statute a bar to such a suit., It said that 'the limitation created by the statute is upon the jurisdiction of the court in that it is declared that the holder of notes given to secure the purchase price of real property 'shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account' thereof., This closes the courts of this state to one who seeks a deficiency judgment on a note given for the purchase price of real property., The statute operates upon the adjective law of the state, which pertains to the practice and procedure, [330 U.S. 183, 188] or legal machinery by which the substantive law is made effective, and not upon the substantive law itself., It is a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.' 220 N.C. 18, 20, 16 S.E.2d 411, 412, 136 A.L.R. 1054 But the allowable 'limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts' of North Carolina presents more than a question of local law for determination by the North Carolina Supreme Court., Speaking for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice Brandeis thus expressed the subordination to the requirements of the Constitution of the power of a State to withdraw jurisdiction from its courts: 'The power of a state to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them is, of course, subject to the restrictions imposed by the Federal Constitution.' McKnett v. St. Louis &amp; S.F.R. Co., 292 U.S. 230, 233 , 54 S.Ct. 690, 691., The Contract Clause, U.S.Const. Art. 1, 10, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S.Const. art., 4, 1, the Privileges or Immunities Clause, U.S.Const. art. 4, 2, all fetter the freedom of a State to deny access to its courts howsoever much it may regard such withdrawal of jurisdiction 'the adjective law of the State', or the exercise of its right to regulate 'the practice and procedure' of its courts., Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629, 642 , 55 S.Ct. 589, 592, 100 A.L.R. 1133., A State 'cannot escape its constitutional obligations by the simple device of denying jurisdiction in such cases to Courts otherwise competent.', Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U.S. 411, 415 , 40 S.Ct. 371, 372, 10 A.L. R. 716; and see White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646., This pervasive principle of our federal law, constitutional and statutory, was thus put by Mr. Justice Holmes: 'Whatever springes the State may set for those who are endeavoring to assert rights that the State confers, the assertion of Federal rights, w en plainly and reasonably made, is not to be defeated under the name of local practice.', Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U.S. 22, 24 , 44 S.Ct. 13, 14., 4., Here, claims based on the United States Constitution were plainly and reasonably made in the North Caro- [330 U.S. 183, 189] lina suit., The North Carolina Supreme Court met these claims., It met them by saying that the North Carolina statute did not deal with substantive matters but merely with matters regulating local procedure., But whether the claims are based on a federal right or are merely of local concern is itself a federal question on which this Court, and not the Supreme Court of North Carolina, has the last say., That Court could not put a federal claim aside, as though it were not in litigation, by the talismanic word 'jurisdiction'., When an asserted federal right is denied, the sufficiency of the grounds of denial is for this Court to decide., Titus v. Wallick, 306 U.S. 282, 291 , 59 S.Ct. 557, 562., Bullington could have come here, not merely by the grace of this Court on certiorari, but on appeal, as did White in White v. Hart, supra, to challenge, successfully, the right of Georgia to limit the jurisdiction of the Georgia courts; as did the East New York Savings Bank in the recent case of East New York Sav. Bank v. Hahn, 326 U.S. 230 , 66 S.Ct. 69, 160 A.L.R. 1279, to challenge, though unsuccessfully, the limitation which New York placed upon the jurisdiction of its courts., Cf. Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U.S. 411, 416 , 40 S.Ct. 371, 372, 10 A.L.R. 716., Since it was open for Bullington to come here to seek reversal of the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court shutting him out of the North Carolina courts and he chose not to do so, the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded an adjudication of a federal question even though it was not couched in those terms., For purposes of litigating the issues in controversy in the North Carolina action, the North Carolina Supreme Court was an intermediate tribunal., If a litigant chooses not to continue to assert his rights after an intermediate tribunal has decided against him, he has concluded his litigation as effectively as though he had proceeded through the highest tribunal available to him., An adjudication of an issue implies that a man had a chance to win his case., The chance was necessarily afforded by the North Carolina litigation. [330 U.S. 183, 190], It was in process of determination when the Supreme Court of North Carolina decided against him., He forewent his right to have a higher court, this Court, enable him to win his chance by holding that he was right and that the North Carolina Supreme Court was wrong., He cannot begin all over again in an action involving the same issues before another forum in the same State. 5., It is suggested that the North Carolina Supreme Court did not adjudicate the 'merits' of the controversy., It is a misconception of res judicata to assume that the doctrine does not come into operation if a court has not passed on the 'merits' in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation., An adjudication declining to reach such ultimate substantive issues may bar a second attempt to reach them in another court of the State., Such a situation is presented when the first decision is based not on the ground that the distribution of judicial power among the various courts of the State requires the suit to be brought in another court in the State, but on the inaccessibility of all the courts of the State to such litigation., And that is the essence of the present case., The only issue in controversy in the first North Carolina litigation was whether or not all the courts of North Carolina were closed to that litigation., The merits of that issue were adjudicated., And that was the issue raised in the second litigation in North Carolina-that in the federal district court., The merits of this issue having been adjudicated, they cannot be relitigated., The 'merits' of a claim are disposed of when hey are refused enforcement., If an asserted federal claim is denied enforcement on a professed local ground, but a so-called local ground which is subject to review here because it is in fact the adjudication of a federal question, then the 'merits' of that claim were adjudicated in the only sense that adjudication of the 'merits' is relevant to the principles of res judicata., A State court can- [330 U.S. 183, 191] not sterilize federal claims by putting on the adjudication a locl label., 6., The merits of this controversy were adjudicated by the North Carolina Supreme Court since that court, or this Court on appeal, might have decided that the North Carolina statute did not bar Bullington's first action., The North Carolina statute might have been found unconstitutional., Federal issues were thus involved in the adjudication by the North Carolina Supreme Court., Bullington knew that there were federal issues in the State suit because he raised them., ...]</td>\n",

WEST VIRGINIA PULP &amp; PAPER CO.(1947)\\nNo. 184\\nArgued: February 3, 1947Decided: March 3, 1947\\n\\n\\n\\n Motion to Amend Mandate Denied June 16, 1947\\n\\n\\n See \\n331 \\nU.S. 794\\n, 67 S.Ct. 1725.\\n Messrs. H. Wayne Unger, of Walterboro, S.C., and James P. Mozingo, of Darlington, S.C., for petitioner.\\n Messrs. Christie Benet, of Columbia, S.C., and Charles W. Waring of Charleston, S.C., for respondent.\\n\\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n The petitioner brought this action in a South Carolina state court. Upon motion of respondent, it was removed to the Federal District Court because of diversity \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 213]\\n \\n of citizenship of the parties. The complaint claimed $25,000 damages upon allegations that the respondent's agents had trespassed upon and cut timber from lands owned by and in the possession of the petitioner. Respondent's answer denied that the petitioner had title or possession of the lands and timbers. Both title and possession became crucial issues in the trial. The burden of proving them rested on the petitioner. \\n1\\n When all the evidence of both parties had been introduced, the respondent moved for a directed verdict in its favor on the ground that the petitioner had failed to prove that he either owned or was in possession of the land. \\n2\\n This motion was denied. The jury returned a verdict for petitioner for $15, 000, and the court entered judgment on the verdict. The respondent moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. This motion was denied. Respondent did not move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as it might have done under Rule 50(b) of the \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 214]\\n \\n Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is set out below. \\n3\\n \\n\\n The Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the admission of certain evidence offered by the petitioner to prove legal title was prejudicial error. It held that without this improperly admitted evidence petitioner's proof was not sufficient to submit the question of title to the jury. That court also held that petitioner's evidence showing possession was insufficient to go to the jury. It therefore reversed the case. But instead of remanding it to the District Court for a new trial, the Circuit Court of Appeals directed that judgment be entered for respondent. That court has thus construed Rule 50(b) as authorizing an appellate court to direct a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, even though no motion for such a judgment had been made in the District Court within ten days after the jury's discharge.\\n The petition for certiorari challenged the power of an appellate court to direct entry of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict where timely motion for such a judg- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 215]\\n \\n ment had not been made in the District Court. On three previous occasions we have granted certiorari to consider this point but failed to reach it because, upon examination of the evidence, we found it sufficient to justify submission of all three cases to the jury. Conway v. O'Brien, \\n312 \\nU.S. 492\\n, 61 S.Ct. 634; Berry v. United States, \\n312 \\nU.S. 450\\n, 61 S.Ct. 637; Halliday v. United States, \\n315 \\nU.S. 94\\n, 62 S. Ct. 438. In this case we granted certiorari 'limited to the questions of federal procedure raised by the petition for the writ.' \\n329 \\nU.S. 701\\n, 67 S.Ct. 57. The point we had in mind was whether a party's failure to make a motion in th District Court for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, as permitted in Rule 50(b), precludes an appellate court from directing entry of such a judgment. Other questions have been discussed here, but we do not consider them. Consequently, we accept, without approving or disapproving, the Circuit Court of Appeals' holding that there was prejudicial error in the admission of evidence and in the submission of the case to the jury.\\n Rule 50(b) contains no language which absolutely requires a trial court to enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict even though that court is persuaded that it erred in failing to direct a verdict for the losing party. The rule provides that the trial court 'may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed.' This 'either-or' language means what it seems to mean, namely, that there are circumstances which might lead the trial court to believe that a new trial rather than a final termination of the trial stage of the controversy would better serve the ends of justice. In short, the rule does not compel a trial judge to enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict instead of ordering a new trial; it permits him to exercise a discretion to choose between the two alternatives. See Berry v. United States, supra, \\n312 \\nU.S. 452\\n, \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 216]\\n \\n 453, 61 S.Ct. 638.4 And he can exercise this discretion with a fresh personal knowledge of the issues involved, the kind of evidence given, and the impression made by witnesses. His appraisal of the bona fides of the claims asserted by the litigants is of great value in reaching a conclusion as to whether a new trial should be granted. Determination of whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart. See March v. Philadelphia &amp; West Chester Traction Co., 285 Pa. 413, 418, 132 A. 355; Bunn v. Furstein, 153 Pa.Super. 637, 638, 34 A.2d 924. See also Yutterman v. Sternberg, 8 Cir., 86 F.2d 321, 324, 111 A.L.R. 736. Exercise of this discretion presents to the trial judge an opportunity, after all his rulings have been made and all the evidence has been evaluated, to view the proceedings in a perspective peculiarly available to him alone. He is thus afforded 'a last chance to correct his own errors without delay, expense, or other hardships of an appeal.' See Greer v. Carpenter, 323 Mo. 878, 882, 19 S.W.2d 1046, 1047; Cf. United States v. Johnson, \\n327 \\nU.S. 106, 112\\n, 66 S.Ct. 464, 466. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 217]\\n \\n There are other practical reasons why a litigant should not have his right to a new trial foreclosed without having had the benefit of the trial court's judgment on the question. Take the case where a trial court is about to direct a verdict because of failure of proof in a certain aspect of the case. At that time a litigant might know or have reason to believe that he could fill the crucial gap in the evidence. Traditionally, a plaintiff in such a dilemma has had an unqualifi d right, upon payments of costs, to take a nonsuit in order to file a new action after further preparation, unless the defendant would suffer some plain legal prejudice other than the mere prospect of a second lawsuit. Pleasants v. Fant, 22 Wall. 116, 122; Jones v. S.E.C., \\n298 \\nU.S. 1, 19\\n, 20 S., 56 S.Ct. 654, 659, and cases cited. Rule 41(a)(1) preserves this unqualified right of the plaintiff to a dismissal without prejudice prior to the filing of defendant's answer. And after the filing of an answer, Rule 41(a)(2) still permits a trial court to grant a dismissal without prejudice 'upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.' \\n 5\\n \\n\\n In this case had respondents made a timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the petitioner could have either presented reasons to show why he should have a new trial, or at least asked the court for permission to dismiss. If satisfied from the knowledge acquired from the trial and because of the reasons urged that the ends of justice would best be served by allowing petitioner another chance, the judge could have so provided in his discretion. The respondent failed to submit \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 218]\\n \\n a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the trial judge in order that he might exercise his discretionary power to determine whether there should be such a judgment, a dismissal or a new trial. In the absence of such a motion, we think the appellate court was without power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.\\n It has been suggested that the petitioner could have presented affidavits to the Circuit Court of Appeals to support his claim for a new trial, and that that court could thereupon have remanded the question to the District Court to pass upon it. \\n6\\n Such a circuitous method of determining the question cannot be approved. For Rule 50(b) specifically prescribes a period of ten days for making a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Yet the method here suggested would enable litigants to extend indefinitely the prescribed ten day period simply by adoption of the expedient of an appeal. Furthermore, it would present the question initially to the appellate court when the primary discretionary responsibility for its decision rests on the District Court.\\n Reversed. \\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] Under governing South Carolina law an action such as this is not one to try title but 'to recover damages for trespass of property of which the plaintiff was in possession.' Macedonia Baptist Church v. City of Columbia, 195 S.C. 59, 70, 10 S.E.2d 350, 355. But possession may be presumed from proof of legal title. Beaufort Land and Investment Co. v. New River Lumber Co., 86 S.C. 358, 68 S.E. 637, 30 L.R.A.,N.S., 243; Haithcock v. Haithcock, 123 S.C. 61, 115 S.E. 727; Code of Laws of South Carolina (1942)  377. Petitioner here undertook to prove possession both by showing that he had legal title and by showing that he had openly and notoriously exercised acts of dominion, possession, and ownership over a long period of years. \\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] Respondent first moved to dismiss the case on the same grounds under Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. That rule provides for a dismissal, under the circumstances and conditions there set out where 'upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.' Since substantially the same disposition of the case on the same grounds was later requested by respondent in the motion for a directed verdict, we shall have no occasion further to discuss the motion to dismiss. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 3\\n] 50(b) 'Reservation of Decision on Motion. Whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion. Within 10 days after the reception of a verdict, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict .... A motion for a new trial may be joined with this motion, or a new trial may be prayed for in the alternative. If a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed. If no verdict was returned the court may direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed or may order a new trial. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 4\\n] The Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure in commenting on Rule 50(b) stated that 'A trial court or an appellate court in setting aside a verdict always has discretion, if justice requires it, to order a new trial, instead of directing the entry of judgment. Rule 50(b) states that the court on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 'may either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment' for the moving party.'

Hansard, 45 Wyo. 201, 218, 17 P.2d 659. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 5\\n] Rule 41(a)(2), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, has been interpreted as authorizing a plaintiff to dismiss his action 'without prejudice where the court believes that although there is a technical failure of proof there is nevertheless a meritorious claim.' Report of Proposed Amendments to Rules of Civil Procedure (1946) 64; see United States v. Lyman, 1 Cir., 125 F.2d 67; Lyman v. United States, 1 Cir., 138 F.2d 509; Home Owners' Loan Corporation v. Huffman, 8 Cir., 134 F.2d 314, 317. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 6\\n] This general suggestion was made by the Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure in its recent recommendation to us for modification of Rule 50(b). The Committee said: 'Even on appeal, if the appellate court sets aside his verdict, he may present to the appellate court affidavits to support his claim to a new trial, and the appellate court has power to receive the affidavits and remand the case to the trial court with instructions to consider the affidavits and determine whether a new trial should be allowed.'

S.E.C., 298 U.S. 1, 19 , 20 S., 56 S.Ct. 654, 659, and cases cited., Rule 41(a)(1) preserves this unqualified right of the plaintiff to a dismissal without prejudice prior to the filing of defendant's answer., And after the filing of an answer, Rule 41(a)(2) still permits a trial court to grant a dismissal without prejudice 'upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.', 5 In this case had respondents made a timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the petitioner could have either presented reasons to show why he should have a new trial, or at least asked the court for permission to dismiss., If satisfied from the knowledge acquired from the trial and because of the reasons urged that the ends of justice would best be served by allowing petitioner another chance, the judge could have so provided in his discretion., The respondent failed to submit [330 U.S. 212, 218] a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the trial judge in order that he might exercise his discretionary power to determine whether there should be such a judgment, a dismissal or a new trial., In the absence of such a motion, we think the appellate court was without power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand., It has been suggested that the petitioner could have presented affidavits to the Circuit Court of Appeals to support his claim for a new trial, and that that court could thereupon have remanded the question to the District Court to pass upon it., 6 Such a circuitous method of determining the question cannot be approved., For Rule 50(b) specifically prescribes a period of ten days for making a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict., Yet the method here suggested would enable litigants to extend indefinitely the prescribed ten day period simply by adoption of the expedient of an appeal., Furthermore, it would present the question initially to the appellate court when the primary discretionary responsibility for its decision rests on the District Court., Reversed. Footnotes, [ Footnote 1 ], Under governing South Carolina law an action such as this is not one to try title but 'to recover damages for trespass of property of which the plaintiff was in possession.', Macedonia Baptist Church v. City of Columbia, 195 S.C. 59, 70, 10 S.E.2d 350, 355., But possession may be presumed from proof of legal title., Beaufort Land and Investment Co. v. New River Lumber Co., 86 S.C. 358, 68 S.E. 637, 30 L.R.A.,N.S., 243; Haithcock v. Haithcock, 123 S.C. 61, 115 S.E. 727; Code of Laws of South Carolina (1942), 377., Petitioner here undertook to prove possession both by showing that he had legal title and by showing that he had openly and notoriously exercised acts of dominion, possession, and ownership over a long period of years., [ Footnote 2 ], Respondent first moved to dismiss the case on the same grounds under Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c., That rule provides for a dismissal, under the circumstances and conditions there set out where 'upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.', Since substantially the same disposition of the case on the same grounds was later requested by respondent in the motion for a directed verdict, we shall have no occasion further to discuss the motion to dismiss., [ Footnote 3 ] 50(b) 'Reservation of Decision on Motion., Whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion., Within 10 days after the reception of a verdict, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict ...., A motion for a new trial may be joined with this motion, or a new trial may be prayed for in the alternative., If a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed., If no verdict was returned the court may direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed or may order a new trial., [ Footnote 4 ], The Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure in commenting on Rule 50(b) stated that 'A trial court or an appellate court in setting aside a verdict always has discretion, if justice requires it, to order a new trial, instead of directing the entry of judgment., Rule 50(b) states that the court on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 'may either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment' for the moving party.', Report of Proposed Amendments to Rules of Civil Procedure (1946) 66., See also New York Symposium on Federal Rules (1938) 283-284., Compare March v.

       "0  \\n\\nUnited States Supreme Court\\nUNITED STATES v. THAYER-WEST POINT HOTEL CO.(1947)\\nNo. 106\\nArgued: December 20, 1946Decided: January 20, 1947\\n\\n\\n\\n Mr.\\nOscar H. Davis, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner. \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 586]\\n \\n Mr.E. J. Ellenwood, of New York City, for respondent.\\n\\n Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n The decision here turns upon the power of the Court of Claims, in light of  177(a) of the Judicial Code,1 to include interest in its award of 'just compensation' to a lessee for the construction of a hotel and other buildings pursuant to the provisions of the Act of March 30, 1920.2\\n The act of March 30, 1920, authorizes the Secretary of War to lease land on the United States Military Reservation at West Point, N.Y., to any person for a term not exceeding 50 years upon which to erect a hotel and other necessary buildings in connection therewith. The lease is to contain such conditions, terms, reservations and covenants as may be agreed upon and is to provide 'for just compensation to the lessees for the construction of said hotel, appurtenances, and equipments, to be paid to said lessees at the termination of said lease.'\\n On October 17, 1924, the Secretary of War duly made a lease under this Act to one Williams for a period of 50 years. The lease provided, among other things, that it might be cancelled at any time by the Secretary if the lessee should fail to observe all the covenants and conditions in the lease. One of the covenants was that the lessee was to 'keep the said hotel open for business every day during the continuance of this lease, except at such times as permission to close may be given in writing by the Superintendent, U.S.M.A.' Upon a cancellation of the lease, 'just compensation' was to be paid to the lessee for the construction of the hotel, appurtenances and equipment, and title thereto was to pass at once to the United States. \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 587]\\n \\n Similar provisions were made in connection with the termination of the lease on the expiration of the 50-year term. The lease also set forth numerous restrictions and requirements as to the operation of the hotel- such restrictions and requirements being primarily for the benefit of the Military Academy.\\n The lease was assigned to a corporation and a hotel and other buildings were subsequently erected. Through a series of events which need not be detailed here, the respondent took over the leasehold and the hotel properties in 1930 with the approval of the Superintendent of the Military Academy. Respondent began operating the hotel on January 1, 1931, and continued under the terms of the lease until March 10, 1943\\n\\n\\n On January 5, 1943, respondent wrote to the Secretary of War that conditions then existing made continued operation of the hotel impossible and that to avoid a curtailment of operations or a closing down of the hotel 'the properties should be owned and operated by the Government.' It was accordingly suggested that the Secretary declare the lease forfeited upon the closing of the hotel by respondent, a default contemplated by the lease. The Secretary agreed to this proposal. The respondent then gave notice of its intention to close the hotel on the morning of March 10, 1943. The agents of the Secretary immediately took over the possession, management and operation of the hotel on March 10 and shortly thereafter the Secretary declared the lease annulled.\\n The parties were unable to agree on the amount of 'just compensation' due under the lease. Respondent then brought this suit in the Court of Claims, praying for a judgment in the sum of $1,932.000. That court found that the 'total of just compensation to the plaintiff for construction of the hotel, its appurtenances, and equipments, is therefore $867,682, as of March 10, 1943.' 64 \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 588]\\n \\n F.Supp. 565, 568. The court then added interest at the rate of 4% per annum from March 10, 1943, to the date of payment as 'additional allowance to make compensation a just one as of the date of payment.' The sole question before us concerns the propriety of adding the 4% interest from March 10, 1943.\\n The pertinent part of  177(a) of the Judicial Code provides that 'No interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the phyment of interest, ....' Section 177(a) thus embodies the traditional rule that interest cannot be recovered against the United States upon unpaid accounts or claims in the absence of an express provision to the contrary in a relevant statute or contract. Tillson v. United States, \\n100 \\nU.S. 43\\n, 47; United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., \\n253 \\nU.S. 30, 336\\n, 40 S.Ct. 518, 521; United States v. Goltra, \\n312 \\nU.S. 203, 207\\n, 61 S. Ct. 487, 490. This rule is inapplicable, however, where the United States takes property under its power of eminent domain; in such cases it has consistently been held that the Fifth Amendment's reference to 'just compensation' entitles the property owner to receive interest from the date of the taking to the date of payment as a part of his just compensation. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, \\n261 \\nU.S. 299, 306\\n, 43 S.Ct. 354, 356; Brooks-Scanlon Corporation v. United States, \\n265 \\nU.S. 106, 123\\n, 44 S.Ct. 471, 474; Phelps v. United States, \\n274 \\nU.S. 341, 344\\n, 47 S.Ct. 611, 612.\\n Since it is clear in the instant case that the United States did not exercise its power of eminent domain and that there was no taking of the hotel properties in the legal sense, we can put to one side the eminent domain situation. There is nothing more here than an ordinary contractual relationship between the United States and the respondent. That relationship was voluntarily entered into by respondent's predecessor and was severed at respondent's suggestion. The Government's liability to \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 589]\\n \\n pay for the construction of the hotel properties was fixed by the Act of March 30, 1920, and by the lease, not by the Constitution. The sole issue thus becomes whether there is any express provision in the Act or in the lease permitting the recovery of interest under the circumstances. Only if there is such a provision can respondent avoid the traditional rule set forth in  177(a).\\n Respondent's claim in this respect rests upon the references in the Act and in the lease to the payment of 'just compensation' for the construction of the hotel, appurtenances and equipment. 'Just compensation,' it is said, is to be given the same meaning here as in the case of a taking under the power of eminent domain, thereby entitling respondent to the full value of the properties down to the date of payment. From this viewpoint, the Court of Claims could use interest at the rate of 4% as the measure of the value of the use of the hotel properties from the time when the Government took possession on March 10, 1943, to the time of payment and include such interest as a component part of just compensation. The conclusion is reached that the term 'just compensation,' as used in the Act and in the lease, constitutes an express provision for interest so that the bar of  177(a) is removed. We cannot agree.\\n The fact that 'just compensation' includes interest in the eminent domain setting does not necessarily mean that the term must be given the same scope in other situations. United States v. Goltra, supra. It may or it may not imply an obligation to pay interest. For example, interest conceivably may not be contemplated where the term refers to compensatory damages for a tort or a breach of contract, or where it has reference to the price to be paid for the exchange or sale of property at a future date. Hence, in the absence of constitutional connotations, 'just compensation' is not a term of art so far as interest is \\n\\n[329 \\nU.S. 585, 590]\\n \\n concerned. The inclusion or exclusion of interest depends upon other contractual provisions, the intention of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the use of the term.\\n But in order to override the historical rule codified in  177(a), something more is necessary than an equivocal use of the term 'just compensation.' It is not enough that the term might be construed to include the payment of interest. As  177(a) itself indicates, there must be a provision in the contract 'expressly stipulating for the payment of interest.' That provision must be affirmative, clear-cut, unambiguous; and an unexpressed intention by the parties that the term 'just compensation' be construed to include interest is insufficient. Likewise, where a statute is relied upon to overcome the force of  177(a), the intention of Congress to permit the rec very of interest must be expressly and specifically set forth in the statute. Tillson v. United States, supra, 100 U.S. at page 46; United States ex rel. Angarica de la Rua v. Bayard, \\n127 \\nU.S. 251, 260\\n, 8 S.Ct. 1156, 1160, 1161. Mere use of the term 'just compensation,' without more, is no substitute for an express provision for interest.\\n Here neither the Act of March 30, 1920, nor the lease under which respondent operated contains an express provision for the payment of interest, either in addition to or as a part of the 'just compensation' to be paid to respondent. If the United States had desired to provide by statute or to contract in the lease for the payment of interest, it would have been easy to have said so in express terms. \\n3\\n Because it did not say so, we are led irresistibly to the conclusion that it did not intend to negative the effect of  177(a) in this instance. Tillson v.

       "1  \\n\\nUnited States Supreme Court\\nBOZZA v. UNITED STATES(1947)\\nNo. 190\\nArgued: Decided: February 17, 1947\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 162]\\n \\n Mr. W. Marvin Smith, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\\n Mr. Harold Simandl, of Newark, N.J., for petitioner.\\n\\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n The petitioner and one Chirichillo were convicted in a Federal District Court on all counts of a five-count indictment against them which charged violation of the Internal Revenue laws in connection with the operation of a still. The Court of Appeals reversed petitioner's conviction on counts four and five because of insufficient evidence, but affirmed as to counts one, two, and three. 3 Cir., 155 F.2d 592. We granted certiorari. \\n329 \\nU.S. 698\\n, 67 S.Ct. 58. Count one charged that the defendants had carried on 'the business of a distiller ... with intent willfully to defraud the ... United States of the tax on ... spirits so distilled ...' in violation of 26 U.S.C.  2833(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  2833(a). Count two charged them with having had possession and custody of the still in violation of 26 U.S.C.  2810(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code,  2810(a). Count three charged that they had made and fermented mash for the production of alcohol in violation of 26 U.S.C.  2834, 26 U. S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  2834. It is argued that the evidence was insufficient to support any of the three counts here at issue. The Government concedes its insufficiency as to counts two and three.\\n There was testimony to show the following: Chirichillo rented a farmhouse under an assumed name and installed a 300-gallon still with all equipment necessary to ferment mash and distill alcohol. The still was operated day and night. Chirichillo himself mixed the ingredients to make the mash in the attic of the 2 1/2-story frame building, but the alcohol distillation was carried on in another part of the building. Petitioner was at the house two or three times a week. When there he took instructions from \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 163]\\n \\n Chirichillo and helped him in the operation of the still; he helped manufacture the alcohol. When Chirichillo carried his products to Newark, the car in which he carried the illicitly distilled alcohol would follow along behind another car-sometimes petitioner's, sometimes another helper's. The farmhouse where the illicit business was carried on appeared from the outside to be deserted; the windows were without shades and the house had been practically stripped of furniture.\\n We accept the Government's concession that the evidence fails to show that this petitioner had made, or helped to make, the mash as charged in count three. All of the evidence showed that Chirichillo alone handled and mixed the ingredients of the mash, and there is nothing whatever to indicate that the petitioner ever took any part in, or aided and abetted, this particular part of the unlawful process in any manner, or, indeed, that he was ever in or around the attic where the mash was made from ingredients stored there. The Internal Revenue statutes have broken down the various steps and phases of a continuous illicit distilling business and made each of them a separate offense. Thus, these statutes have clearly carved out the conduct of making mash as a separate offense, thereby distinguishing it from the other offenses involving other steps and phases of the distilling business. Consequently, testimony to prove this separate offense of making mash must point directly to conduct within the narrow margins which the statute alone d fines. One who neither engages in the conduct specifically prohibited, nor aids and abets it, does not violate the section which prohibits it.\\n The sufficiency of the evidence as to count two which charged that the petitioner had custody or possession of the still is a closer question. It might be possible that petitioner's helping to make the alcohol aided and abetted in its 'custody or possession.' But that would be a very strained inference under any circumstances. Here again \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 164]\\n \\n the statutes treat custody or possession as a wholly distinct offense. Yet there was no testimony that the petitioner ever exercised, or aided the exercise of, any control over the distillery. His participation in carrying the finished product by car does not fit the category of 'custody and possession' so nearly as it resembles the transportation of illegal liquor, 26 U.S.C.  2803, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  2803-an offense which the Circuit Court of Appeals has found the evidence insufficient to prove. Nor was there any testimony that the petitioner acted in any other capacity calculated to facilitate the custody or possession, such as, for illustration, service as a caretaker, watchman, lookout, or in some other similar capacity. Under these circumstances, we accept the Government's concession that a judgment of guilty should not have been rendered on the second count.\\n We think there was adequate evidence to support a finding of guilt on the first count which charged operation of the business of distilling to defraud the Government of taxes. There was certainly ample evidence to show that Chirichillo carried on the business of a distiller and that the petitioner helped him to do it. 18 U.S.C.  550, 18 U.S.C.A.  550, provides that one who aids and abets another to commit a crime is guilty as a principal. Consequently, the jury had a right to find, as it did, that the petitioner and Chirichillo were equally guilty of operating the business of the distillery. See United States v. Johnson, \\n319 \\nU.S. 503, 515\\n, 518 S., 63 S.Ct. 1233, 1239, 1240\\n\\n\\n But, it is argued, there was no evidence that the petitioner acted with knowledge that the distillery business was carried on with an intent to defraud the Government of its taxes. The same evidence as to knowledge of this guilty purpose, however, that applied to Chirichillo was almost, if not quite, equally persuasive against both defendants. Petitioner assisted in the manufacture of alcohol in Chirichillo's still which was operated under con- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 165]\\n \\n ditions of secretiveness in an apparently abandoned farmhouse. The finished alcohol was carried to Newark in a car which followed another car, sometimes the petitioner's. The members of the jury could properly draw on their own experience and observations that lawful stills, unlike the still in which petitioner worked, usually are not operated clandestinely and do not deliver their products in the fashion employed here. The members of the jury were not precluded from drawing inferences as to fraudulent purposes from these circumstances, nor were they compelled to believe that this petitioner was oblivious of the purposes of what went on around him. Men in the jury box, like men on the street, can conclude that a person who actively helps to operate a secret distillery knows that he is helping to violate Government revenue laws. That is a well known object of an illicit distillery. Doubtless few who ever worked in such a place, or even heard about one, would fail to understand the cry: 'The Revenuers are coming!' We hold that the verdict of guilty on the first count must stand.\\n The only statute for violation of which petitioner's conviction is sustained by us carries a minimum mandatory sentence of fine of one hundred dollars and imprisonment, 26 U.S.C.  2833(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code,  2833(a). In announcing sentence at a morning session, the trial judge mentioned imprisonment only. Thereafter the petitioner was taken briefly to the U.S. Marshal's office and then to a local federal detention jail awaiting transportation to the penitentiary where he was finally to be confined. But about five hours after the sentence was announced, the judge recalled the petitioner and according to stipulation, stated in the presence of petitioner and his counsel that 'in the imposition of sentence this morning ... it has been called to my attention that there are certain mandatory fines and penalties which I omitted to impose. For the record now minimum mandatory fines and penalties will be imposed.' Thus a one \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 166]\\n \\n hundred dollar fine was fixed as required by law, along with the imprisonment sentence. Petitioner charges that this action constituted double jeopardy forbidden by the Federal Constitution.\\n It is well established that a sentence which does not comply with the letter of the criminal statute which authorizes it is so erroneous that it may be set aside on appeal, Reynolds v. United States, \\n98 \\nU.S. 145, 168\\n, 169 S., 8 Otto 145, 168, 169; Murphy v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \\n177 \\nU.S. 155, 157\\n, 20 S.Ct. 639, 640, or in habeas corpus proceedings. In re Bonner, \\n151 \\nU.S. 242\\n, 14 S.Ct. 323. But in those cases it was recognized that an excessive sentence should be corrected, even though the prisoner had already served part of his term, not by absolute discharge of the prisoner, but by an appropriate amendment of the invalid sentence by the court of original jurisdiction, at least during the term of court in which the invalid sentence was imposed. \\n1\\n Cf. De Benque v. United States, 66 App.D.C. 36, 85 F.2d 202, 106 A.L.R. 839. In the light of these cases, the fact that petitioner has been twice before the judge for sentencing and in a federal place of detention during the five hour interim cannot be said to constitute double jeopardy as we have heretofore considered it. Petitioner contends, however, that these cases are inapplicable here because correction of this sentence so as to make it lawful increases his punishment. Cf. United States v. Benz, \\n282 \\nU.S. 304, 309\\n, 51 S.Ct. 113, 114. If this inadvertent error cannot be corrected in the manner used here by the trial court, no valid and enforceable sentence can be imposed at all. Cf. Jordan v. United States, 4 Cir., 60 F.2d 4, 6 with Barrow v. United States, 54 App.D.C. 128, 295 F. 949. This Court has rejected the 'doctrine that a prisoner, whose guilt is established by a regular verdict, is to escape punishment altogether because the court committed an error in passing the sentence.' In re Bonner, supra, 151 U.S. at page 260, 14 S.Ct. at page 327. The Constitution does not require that sentencing should be a game \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 167]\\n \\n in which a wrong move by the judge means immunity for the prisoner. See King v. United States, 69 App.D.C. 10, 98 F.2d 291, 296. In this case the court 'only set aside what it had no authority to do, and substitute(d) directions required by the law to be done upon the conviction of the offender.' In re Bonner, supra, 151 U.S. at page 260, 14 S.Ct. at page 327. It did not twice put petitioner in jeopardy for the same offense. \\n2\\n The sentence as corrected, imposes a valid punishment for an offense instead of an invalid punishment for that offense.\\n Other contentions here do not merit our discussion. The judgment as to count one is affirmed. The judgment is reversed as to counts two and three.\\n It is so ordered.\\n Affirmed in part and reversed in part.\\n\\n Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Mr. Justice MURPHY, and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE dissenting as to the affirmance of the judgment on count one.\\n We are of the view that to convict one as an aider and abetter in engaging in or carrying on a distillery business with intent 'to defraud' the United States of the tax on the distilled spirits, 53 Stat. 319, 26 U. S.C.  2833(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code,  2833(a), evidence is necessary which shows that by some act of concealment he promoted the fraud, or by counsel and advice furthered the unlawful scheme, or in fact had \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 168]\\n \\n some interest in the project. 1 See United States v. Cooper, 25 Fed.Cas. pages 627, 629, No. 14,863; United States v. Logan, 26 Fed.Cas. pages 900, 992, No. 15,624; Seiden v. United States, 2 Cir., 16 F.2d 197, 199; Partson v. United States, 8 Cir., 20 F.2d 127, 129; Anderson v. United States, 5 Cir., 30 F.2d 485, 487. Aiding and abetting in the illicit manufacture of liquor is one thing. \\n2\\n Aiding and abetting in carrying on the business with intent to defraud the United States of a tax is quite a different matter, and requires a different test, if the two offenses are not to be blended. The evidence in the case and the instructions given the jury3 seem to us inadequate to sustain a con- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 160, 169]\\n \\n viction under count one, charging Bozza with aiding and abetting in a tax fraud scheme.\\n In view of this conclusion, Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE reserves expression of opinion concerning the legality of the sentence. \\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] Compare Rule 45(c), Rules of Criminal Procedure for the District Courts of the United States, 18 U.S.C.A. following section 687. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] In Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, relied on by petitioner here, the defendant had been sentenced to fine and imprisonment for violation of a statute which authorized a sentence only of fine or imprisonment. Since he had paid his fine and therefore suffered punishment under a valid sentence, it was held that his sentence had been 'executed by full satisfaction of one of the alternative penalties of the law ....' Murphy v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, supra, 177 U.S. at page 160, 20 S. Ct. at page 641. Therefore, Lange's plea, that the trial court could not correct the sentenc without causing him to suffer double punishment, was sustained. Cf. In re Bradley, \\n318 \\nU.S. 50\\n, 63 S.Ct. 470. But here the petitioner had not suffered any lawful punishment until the court had announced the full mandatory sentence of imprisonment and fine. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] Judge Learned Hand, after reviewing the various definitions of aiding and abetting, said: 'It will be observed that all these definitions have nothing whatever to do with the probability that the forbidden result would follow upon the accessory's conduct; and that they all demand that he in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed. All the words used-even the most colorless, 'abet'-carry an implication of purposive attitude towards it.' United States v. Peoni, 2 Cir., 100 F.2d 401, 402. \\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] Thus  2833(a) makes it an offense to 'carry on the business of a distiller without having given bond as required by law.' Section 2834 makes it unlawful to make or ferment mash, fit for distillation, in any building or on any premises other than an authorized distillery. \\n[\\nFootnote 3\\n] '... if you find that he was merely an underling, serving at the beck and call of an employer and nothing more than that (sic) would not justify your finding him to be engaged in the business of a distiller. But if from the evidence you conclude logically that he aided and abetted in the carrying on of this business, then he would be chargeable as a principal. ... Aiding and abetting is something more than merely committing an act which may have the effect of assisting or furthering a criminal transaction. Before a defendant can be held as an aider and abetter the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed an act which furthered or assisted the criminal transaction, and at the time he committed the act he knew that a crime was in process of commission, and with that knowledge he acted with intent to aid and abet in the criminal transaction.' While the above charges were requested by defendant, we nevertheless feel that the failure of the instructions to satisfy the standard we suggest is an error which we should notice. Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., \\n312 \\nU.S. 1, 16\\n, 61 S.Ct. 422, 427. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n

Sonosky, of Washington D.C., for respondent.\\n\\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n Petitioners brought this action in the Court of Claims under the Act of June 28, 1938, 52 Stat. 1209, as amended, 55 Stat. 593, to recover compensation for lands made available to them by an 1875 Executive Order of the President and sub-sequently taken from them by the United States. Their claim was that by an Act of June 15, 1880, 21 Stat. 199, Congress had undertaken to sell these lands for the benefit of the petitioners, but that they had never been compensated for them. The Court of Claims, one judge concurring specially, made findings of fact and concluded as a matter of law that petitioners had no compensable interest in the lands because they 'never did acquire title to these ... lands and ... the Congress never did agree to sell them for the account of' petitioners. Ct. Cl., 64 F.Supp. 569, 571. We granted certiorari, \\n329 \\nU.S. 694\\n, 67 S.Ct. 50.\\n The findings of the Court of Claims from official letters, Executive Orders and statutes incorporated in these findings were as follows: \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 172]\\n \\n A treaty of March 2, 1868, 15 Stat. 619, between the United States and petitioners' ancestors, the Ute Indian tribes, established a reservation for them in Colorado. The northern boundary of the 15 million acres there ceded was described in the treaty as a line fifteen miles north of, and parallel to the 40th parallel of north latitude. In the 15- mile wide strip north of the 40th parallel lay the White River Valley which had been settled by the Utes as a most suitable place for grazing and cultivation. One of the two Government Indian agencies provided for the reservation by the treaty was established in that strip.\\n As a result of misunderstandings in 1869 and 1874 between the Utes and white settlers to the north as to the true location of the northern treaty boundary, a survey was made in 1875 by one Miller. Miller's instructions, however, required him to stake out a line which he admitted to the local Indian agent and to the Utes themselves to be fifteen to eighteen miles south of the true boundary described in the treaty. If Miller's line had been correct, it would have excluded from the 1868 reservation the fertile White River Valley, and would have also excluded the agency buildings which had been erected there.\\n The marking out of the erroneous Miller line greatly upset the Indians because they feared they would be driven from the White River Valley. This embarrassed the local Indian agent who had previously assured the Indians that the White River Valley lay within their reservation. He promptly reported the results of the survey and the reaction of the Indians to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, and urged the necessity of a new survey at the earliest practicable date. He stated that if the Miller survey were correct, however, the Indians would be driven from the White River Valley-'the only farming land and stock range in this part of the reservation'-and forced to settle on \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 173]\\n \\n a river forty miles to the south. The Commissioner, acting on this report and a statement by Miller's attorney that Miller's line was correct, wrote to the Secretary of the Interior that the Miller survey 'develops the fact that the White River and surrounding valleys as well as the Agency buildings and improvements at the White River Agency lie north of the ... boundary and consequently are not within the limits of the ... Ute Reservation.' He therefore recommended to the Secretary that the President be requested to issue an Executive Order to make available to the Utes additional territory north of the 1868 treaty boundary. The President, on t e recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, issued the order. \\n1\\n And thereafter the Commissioner wrote the local agent that the order included 'all that tract of country lying between the north boundary of the Ute reservation as defined in the treaty of March 2, 1868 ... which was the boundary surveyed by Mr. Miller. ... This action fully protects your Indians in the peaceable possession of their improvements in the White River Valley and the Agency buildings, and will enable you to assure the Indians of the exact location of their reservation as enlarged.' \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 174]\\n \\n In 1879, several years after the Executive Order was issued, hostilities broke out between some of the Utes and Government representatives in which the Indian agent at White River, all the agency's male employees, and a U.S. military detachment were killed in the so- called 'Meeker massacre.' Ex. Doc. No. 1, pt. 5, 47th Cong., 2d Sess. ( 1879) 16-19, 82-97. There have been charges and counter-charges as to who was responsible for inciting these hostilities. Whoever was responsible, it is clear that Congress, aroused by the massacre, took steps to punish the Indians who participated in it, to dispossess the Utes of their reservation, and to remove them from Colorado. Congressional action to accomplish this was provided by the Act of June 15, 1880, 21 Stat. 199, which ratified and embodied an agreement reached earlier that year between the Government and the leaders of the Utes who had promised 'to use their best endeavors with their people to procure their consent to cede to the United States all the territory of the present Ute Reservation ....' This Act authorized specific allotments to individual Indians from the lands so ceded. But  3 provided that 'all the lands not ... allotted, the title to which is, by the said agreement of ... the Ute Indians, and this acceptance by the United States, released and conveyed to the United States ...' would be restored to the public domain for sale as public lands. The proceeds of the sale of the land so conveyed by the Utes to the United States were, upon satisfaction of indemnity conditions imposed because of the massacre, to be distributed to the Indians. Thereafter, in 1882, an Executive Order declared that the lands withdrawn from the public domain by the Executive Order of 1875 and 'set apart for the use of the ... Ute Indians ... hereby is, restored to the public domain.' 1 Kappler, supra, pp. 834, 834.\\n Pursuant to an Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 781, petitioners recovered a judgment for the proceeds of certain lands sold \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 175]\\n \\n by the Government, as well as the value of certain lands appropriated by the Government to its own use, all of which were part of the 1868 treaty lands. The Ute Indians v. United States, 45 Ct.Cl. 440; 46 Ct.Cl. 225. Thus, except for certain treaty lands not at issue here, litigation concerning which is now pending in the Court of Claims, the only lands in Colorado for which the Indians have not been paid are those to the north of and outside the 1868 treaty reservation which were made avail ble to them by the Executive Order of 1875. In pursuit of compensation for these Executive Order lands, petitioners have brought this action pursuant to the Act of June 28, 1938, supra. That Act confers jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to hear, determine, and render final judgment on all legal and equitable claims of the Utes and to award judgment for the Indians where it is found 'that any lands formerly belonging' to them 'have been taken by the United States without compensation ....'\\n Petitioners contend here that their predecessors understood that they not only owned the White River Valley lands, but that they also owned the Executive Order lands when, in 1880, they agreed to cede their reservation; and that Congress, by incorporating the agreement in the 1880 Act, thereby ratified it along with the Indians' understanding of it. Petitioners further contend that whether or not Congress intended to obligate the Government to account for the Executive Order lands, they knew of the Indians' understanding so that 'the understanding of the Indians having been established,' their understanding entitles them to recover. Finally they argue that the Executive Order unlike the one in issue in Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, \\n316 \\nU.S. 317\\n, 62 S.Ct. 1095, conveyed a compensable interest to these Indians. The Government counters that the President had no power to give a compensable interest to the Indians to lands lying outside the true 1868 treaty boundaries; that if the President intended \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 176]\\n \\n to make available lands outside the true boundary it was only to give a transitory, possessory, and not a compensable, interest; that his intent was, in fact, only to secure the Indians in their possession of the White River Valley, but no more, on the mistaken assumption that the White River Valley had been cut off from the reservation by the Miller survey; that the 1880 Act, neither by its terms, its legislative history, nor its administrative interpretation, suggests that Congress intended to ratify or expand the Executive Order or to compensate the Indians for the Executive Order lands; that the Indians did not have a contrary understanding; that in the face of such clear legislative language and intent, a contrary understanding of the Indians, even if established, could not justify a holding that the Indians obtained a compensable interest.\\n It is conceded that the petitioners have either been, or are currently pressing litigation in the Court of Claims by which they seek to be, compensated for the White River Valley lands, and in fact, for all of the land which was contained in the true boundaries of the 1868 reservation. The additional claim, insofar as it rests on the Executive Order of 1875, cannot be sustained. For the President had no authority to convey to the petitioners a compensable interest in the lands described in the order lying north of the true 1868 boundary. Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, supra. \\n2\\n Nor is there any indication in the findings that the President intended to convey more than a transitory, possessory interest by the 1875 Order. That order made the Indians no more than tenants at the will of the Government on that part of the land outside the true treaty reservation. Id. 316 U.S. at page 331, 62 S.Ct. at page 1101. Moreover, the Court of Claims' findings of fact, as emphasized \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 177]\\n \\n by the special concurring opinion, indicate that the Executive Order was promulgated under the mistaken belief that its issuance was necessary in order to give the Indians the use of the White River Valley lands intended to be granted to them by the 1868 treaty and from which they might otherwise have been excluded by the Miller survey. These findings do not indicate that the Commissioner, the Secretary, or the President intended the order to make available the lands it in fact described lying north of the true treaty boundary. The order was designed only to resolve the misunderstanding created by Miller about the White River Valley lands. \\n3\\n The fullest possible purpose of the Executive Order has actually been carried out. For the Indians' enjoyment of the White River lands was protected during their stay on the reservation, and the lands have either already been paid for, or are the subject of pending litigation in the Court of Claims whereby the Indians seek payment for them. It is with these things in mind that we must consider petitioner's contention that they have a right to recover compensation because of the 1880 Act.\\n There is not one word in that Act showing a congressional purpose to convey the Executive Order lands, or any other lands, to the Indians. On the contrary, the Act embodied a transaction whereby the Indians were the transferors and conveyed lands to the Government. For the value of lands so conveyed, and for no other, the Government was to make an account to the Indians after certain deductions had been made. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 178]\\n \\n Nor is it possible to deduce from the 1880 Act a congressional purpose to transform the Executive Order into a conveyance of something more than a mere temporary and cancellable possessory right to the Indians. Neither the language of the 1880 Act, its legislative history, nor the circumstances which brought it about, justify the claim that Congress intended to expand the Executive Order into a transfer of a compensable interest in lands not included in the original treaty reservation. The Act was an aftermath of the 'Meeker massacre.' With the massacre in mind, Congress decided to remove the Indians from the Colorado reservation as part of the punishment meted out for this tragedy. \\n4\\n The very first section of the 1880 Act prohibited any payments at all to the Indians until the Indians involved had surrendered, been apprehended, or until the President had proof that they were dead or outside the United States. Compensation for the families of the massacre victims was to be deducted from the land sale proceeds payable to the Indians. We cannot find from this background a congressional purpose to make a gift to the Indians of the Executive Order lands for which compensation is here sought. The only lands for which Congress agreed in 1880 to compensate the Indians were those that 'the title to which' the Indians then 'released and conveyed to the United States.' They could only release and convey the lands that belonged to them, and only the lands given to them by the original 1868 treaty belonged to them. It was for compensation for such lands only that Congress, in 1938, authorized this action to be maintained. Under all these circumstances, the fact that the 1880 Act required the chiefs and headmen to procure the consent of their people to the cession of 'the present Ute Reservation,' is not sufficient to attribute to Congress \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 179]\\n \\n a purpose to treat as a part of that reservation, lands which had never been legally conveyed to the Indians and which had only been made available to them by the Executive Order for the sole purpose of making them secure in their possession of the White River Valley.\\n It is said, however, that the Indians understood in 1880 that they owned the Executive Order lands which lay north of the White River Valley; that they understood their 'present Ute reservation' to include them; that they understood that Congress undertook by the 1880 Act to sell the lands for their benefit; and that Congress was aware of this understanding. The majority opinion of the Court of Claims stated that 'in all probability' this was true. The writer of the concurring opinion thought differently. But even if the Indians had believed that they had a compensable interest in the Executive Order lands, this fact would not necessarily have given it to them. Certainly the absence of presidential authority to give them a compensable title could not be supplied by the Indians' understanding that the President had such authority. The Sioux Indians may also have thought the President had authority to convey title to them; but the reasons on which our decision in the Sioux case, supra, rested do not indicate that our holding depended in any way upon the understanding of the Indians. Nor can this alleged understanding be imputed to Congress in the face of plain language and a rather full legislative history indicating that the 1880 Act neither conveyed nor ratified conveyance of these lands. While it has long been the rule that a treaty with Indians is to be construed so as to carry out the Government's obligations in accordance with the fair understanding of the Indians, we cannot, under the guise of interpretation, create Presidential authority where there was none, nor rewrite congressional acts so as to make them mean something they obviously were not intended to mean. Choctaw Nation of Indians v. United \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 180]\\n \\n States, \\n318 \\nU.S. 423, 431\\n, 432 S., 63 S.Ct. 672, 677, 678. We cannot, under any acceptable rule of interpretation, hold that the Indians owned the lands merely because they thought so. Solicitous as the Government is to carry out its promises to the Indians in good faith, we are satisfied from this record that the Government has performed all that it promised.\\n As we have pointed out, it seems obvious to us from the findings of the Court of Claims that the Executive Order was only intended to secure for these Indians' ancestors possession of the White River Valley lands conveyed to them by the original 1868 treaty, and which was jeopardized by the Miller survey. 5 In fact, the President had no authority to convey a compensable interest in these or other lands to the Utes. Fairly to carry out the 1868 treaty was the order's aim. The 1880 Act, we believe, did not enlarge upon the limited purpose of the Executive Order. To compensate these Indians for lands, not intended to be conveyed by the 1868 treaty, the Executive Order, nor the 1880 Act, would be to pay them for lands which neither they nor their ancestors ever owned and to which they had no claim in equity or justice, so far as the transactions here at issue are concerned. No rule of construction justifies such a result.\\nAFFIRMED.\\n\\n Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting.\\n The United States, in my opinion, is morally and legally obligated to pay for the land in issue in this case. The Executive Order of 1875 by its terms set aside certain land up to the 'first standard parallel north' for the use of the Ute Indians 'as an addition to their present reservation.' That order alone, of course, could convey no compensable interest to the Indians under the rule of Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, \\n316 \\nU.S. 317\\n, 62 S.Ct. 1095. But events subsequent to \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 181]\\n \\n the issuance of the Executive Order in this case make inapplicable the principle of the Sioux case. In 1880 the United States and the Ute chiefs and headmen entered into an agreement whereby the latter promised 'to use their best endeavors with their people to procure their consent to cede to the United States all the territory of the present Ute Rese vation in Colorado.' Congress thereupon passed the Act of June 15, 1880, which recited in its preamble that the chiefs and headmen had 'submitted to the Secretary of the Interior an agreement for the sale to the United States of their present reservation in the State of Colorado.' The Act then incorporated the agreement previously made and provided that all unallotted lands should be deemed to be released and conveyed to the United States.\\n It seems clear to me that by 1880 the term 'present reservation' included the land which the Executive Order of 1875 stated had been set aside as an addition to the then present reservation. And when the 1880 agreement and the 1880 Act referred to 'present reservation' they must have included that additional land. Adding this informal acknowledgment by Congress of the expanded reservation to the occupation of the land by the Indians and their understaning that it belonged to the reservation, a compensable interest becomes evident. It is immaterial that there was no formal documents conveying a fee simple interest to the Indians; it is likewise irrelevant that there was no formal acknowledgment of the Indian title. Spalding v. Chandler, \\n160 \\nU.S. 394\\n, 16 S.Ct. 360; United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, \\n329 \\nU.S. 40\\n, 67 S.Ct. 167. It is enough that the Indians had the right to possess and occupy the land and that the Indians fairly understood that to be the case. An acknowledgment by Congress, however informal, then adds a legal obligation to the moral duty of the United States to pay for the land involved. Such is the situation here. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 169, 182]\\n \\n The Court indicates, however, that the Executive Order of 1875 does not mean what it says. It clearly set apart for the use of the Indians 'as an addition to the present reservation' all the described land up to the 'first standard parallel north.' But it is now suggested that those responsible for the promulgation of that order did not really intend to set aside all the land up to the 'first standard parallel north,' despite the explicit language used. It is said, rather, that the order actually was designed to affect only the White River Valley lands-lands which are some nine miles south of the 'first standard parallel north.' That interpretation of the intent of the framers of the order would make the northern boundary of the Executive Order land coterminous with the northern boundary of the true treaty reservation.\\n But there is nothing in the findings of the Court of Claims to justify such an interpretation. To disregard the plain words of the order by subtracting a nine-mile strip from a clearly worded description requires definite findings to that effect which are supported by the record. It is not our function, of course, to supply those findings ourselves. Nor can we infer them from the decision of the Court of Claims. That court alone has the power and the duty to make the necessary findings on material issues. 53 Stat. 752, 28 U.S.C.  288, 28 U.S.C.A.  288; United States v. Causby, \\n328 \\nU.S. 256, 267\\n, 268 S., 66 S.Ct. 1062, 1068, 1069. If it is material that the framers of the Executive Order intended to set aside less land than that described in the order, the case should be remanded to the Court of Claims so that it can make the necessary findings in this respect.\\n Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER and Mr. Justice DOUGLAS join in this dissent. \\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] The Executive Order of November 22, 1875, 1 Kappler, Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties, p. 834 (1904) is as follows:\\n'It is hereby ordered that the tract of country in the Territory of Colorado lying within the following-described boundaries, viz: Commencing at the northeast corner of the present Ute Indian Reservation, as defined in the treaty of March 2, 1868 (Stats. at Large, vol. 15, p. 619); thence running north on the 107th degree of longitude to the first standard parallel north; thence west on said first standard parallel to the boundary line between Colorado and Utah; thence south with said boundary to the northwest corner of the Ute Indian Reservation; thence east with the north boundary of the said reservation to the place of beginning, be, and the same hereby is, withdrawn from sale and set apart for the use of the several tribes of Ute Indians, as an addition to the present reservation in said Territory.' \\n\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] Cf. Executive Order of August 17, 1876, which interpreted a treaty so as to 'set apart (certain land) as a part of the Ute Indian Reservation, in accordance with the first article of an agreement made with said Indians and ratified by Congress. ...' 1 Kappler, supra, p. 834. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 3\\n] The Court of Claims did not find this as an ultimate fact. But the correspondence which plainly shows it was incorporated in the findings. This Court has said with reference to findings of the Court of Claims that the 'absence of the finding of an ultimate fact does not require a reversal of the judgment if the circumstantial facts as found are such that the ultimate fact follows from them as a necessary inference.'

       "3  \\n\\nUnited States Supreme Court\\nANGEL v. BULLINGTON(1947)\\nNo. 31\\nArgued: Decided: February 17, 1947\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 184]\\n \\n Mr. George Lyle Jones, of Asheville, N.C., for petitioner.\\n Mr. R. Roy Rush, of Roanoke, Va., for respondent.\\n\\n R. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n In 1940, Bullington, a citizen of Virginia, sold land in Virginia to Angel, a citizen of North Carolina. Only part of the purchase price was paid. For the balance, Angel executed a series of notes secured by a deed of trust on the land. Upon default on one of the notes, Bullington acting upon an acceleration clause in the deed, caused all other notes to become due and called upon the trus- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 185]\\n \\n tees to sell the land. The sale was duly made in Virginia and the proceeds of the sale applied to the payment of the notes. This controversy concerns attempts to collect the deficiency.\\n Bullington began suit for the deficiency in the Superior Court of Macon County, North Carolina. Angel countered with a demurrer, the substance of which was that a statute of North Carolina (c. 36, Public Laws 1933, Mitchie's Code  2593(f)) precluded recovery of such a deficiency judgment. This is the relevant portion of that enactment:\\n'In all sales of real property by mortgagees and/or trustees under powers of sale contained in any mortgage or deed of trust hereafter executed, ... the mortgagee or trustee or holder of the notes secured by such mortgage or deed of trust shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account of such mortgage, deed of trust or obligation secured by the same: ...'.\\n\\n The Superior Court overruled the demurrer, and an appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina followd. Bullington supported his Superior Court judgment on the ground that the United States Constitution precluded North Carolina from shutting the doors of its courts to him. The North Carolina Supreme Court, holding that the North Carolina Act of 1933 barred Bullington's suit against Angel, reversed the Superior Court and dismissed the action. 220 N.C. 18, 16 S.E.2d 411, 136 A.L.R. 1054. Bullington did not seek to review this judgment here. Instead, he sued Angel for the deficiency in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. Angel pleaded in bar the judgment in the North Carolina action. The District Court, 56 F.Supp. 372, gave judgment for Bullington and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 150 F.2d 679. We granted certiorari, \\n326 \\nU.S. 713\\n, 66 S.Ct. 231, because the failure \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 186]\\n \\n to dismiss this action, on the ground that the judgment in the North Carolina court precluded the right thereafter to recover on the same cause of action in the federal court, presented an important question in the administration of justice.\\n\\n 1. \\nWe start with the fact that the prevailing rule as to res judicata is settled law in North Carolina. An adjudication bars future litigation between the same parties not only as to all issues actually raised and decided but also as to those which could have been raised. Southern Distributing Co. v. Carraway, 196 N.C. 58, 60, 61, 144 S.E. 535; Moore v. Harkins, 179 N.C. 167, 101 S.E. 564. When the disposition of a prior litigation is invoked as a bar to an action, the identity of the causes of action in the two suits is usually the bone of contention. On this score there can here be no controversy. It is indisputable that the parties, the nature of the claim and the desired relief were precisely the same in the two actions successively brought by Bullington against Angel, first in the Superior Court of Macon County and then in the federal district court. For all practical purposes, the complaint in the present action was a carbon copy of the complaint in the State court action. If the North Carolina action had been dismissed because it was brought in one North Carolina court rather than in another, of course no federal issue would have been involved. See, e.g., Woods v. Nierstheimer, \\n328 \\nU.S. 211\\n, 66 S.Ct. 996. Had that been the case, a suit for the same cause of action could have been initiated in a North Carolina federal district court, just as another suit could have been brought in the proper North Carolina State court. But that is not the present situation. A quite different situation is before us. Being somewhat unusual, it calls for a critical consideration of the scope and purpose of the doctrine of res judicata.\\n\\n 2. \\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina would clearly bar this suit had it been brought anew \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 187]\\n \\n in a state court. For purp ses of diversity jurisdiction a federal court is 'in effect, only another court of the State'. Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \\n326 \\nU.S. 99, 108\\n, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 1469, 160 A.L.R. 1231; see Madisonville Traction Company v. Saint Bernard Mining Company, \\n196 \\nU.S. 239, 253\\n, 25 S.Ct. 251, 256; Ex parte Schollenberger, \\n96 \\nU.S. 369\\n, 377. Of course, Bullington could not have succeeded in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina after an adverse judgment in the State courts, had the decision in this case involved no federal ground. That is equally true where a federal question was decided in the State courts. That the adjudication of federal questions by the North Carolina Supreme Court may have been erroneous is immaterial for purposes of res judicata. Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, \\n274 \\nU.S. 316, 325\\n, 47 S.Ct. 600, 604. A higher court was available for an authoritative adjudication of the federal questions involved. And so the question is whether federal rights were necessarily involved and adjudicated in the litigation in the State courts.\\n\\n 3. \\nFor purposes of res judicata, the significance of what a court says it decides is controlled by the issues that were open for decision. What were the issues in the North Carolina litigation? Bullington sought a deficiency judgment. Angel, by demurrer, resisted on the ground that a North Carolina statute precluded a deficiency judgment. The North Carolina Supreme Court, reversing the trial court, found the North Carolina statute a bar to such a suit. It said that\\n'the limitation created by the statute is upon the jurisdiction of the court in that it is declared that the holder of notes given to secure the purchase price of real property 'shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account' thereof. This closes the courts of this state to one who seeks a deficiency judgment on a note given for the purchase price of real property. The statute operates upon the adjective law of the state, which pertains to the practice and procedure, \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 188]\\n \\n or legal machinery by which the substantive law is made effective, and not upon the substantive law itself. It is a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.' 220 N.C. 18, 20, 16 S.E.2d 411, 412, 136 A.L.R. 1054\\n\\n\\n\\n But the allowable 'limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts' of North Carolina presents more than a question of local law for determination by the North Carolina Supreme Court. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice Brandeis thus expressed the subordination to the requirements of the Constitution of the power of a State to withdraw jurisdiction from its courts: 'The power of a state to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them is, of course, subject to the restrictions imposed by the Federal Constitution.' McKnett v. St. Louis & S.F.R. Co., \\n292 \\nU.S. 230, 233\\n, 54 S.Ct. 690, 691. The Contract Clause, U.S.Const. Art. 1,  10, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S.Const. art. 4,  1, the Privileges or Immunities Clause, U.S.Const. art. 4,  2, all fetter the freedom of a State to deny access to its courts howsoever much it may regard such withdrawal of jurisdiction 'the adjective law of the State', or the exercise of its right to regulate 'the practice and procedure' of its courts. Broderick v. Rosner, \\n294 \\nU.S. 629, 642\\n, 55 S.Ct. 589, 592, 100 A.L.R. 1133. A State 'cannot escape its constitutional obligations by the simple device of denying jurisdiction in such cases to Courts otherwise competent.' Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \\n252 \\nU.S. 411, 415\\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 372, 10 A.L. R. 716; and see White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646. This pervasive principle of our federal law, constitutional and statutory, was thus put by Mr. Justice Holmes: 'Whatever springes the State may set for those who are endeavoring to assert rights that the State confers, the assertion of Federal rights, w en plainly and reasonably made, is not to be defeated under the name of local practice.' Davis v. Wechsler, \\n263 \\nU.S. 22, 24\\n, 44 S.Ct. 13, 14.\\n\\n 4. \\nHere, claims based on the United States Constitution were plainly and reasonably made in the North Caro- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 189]\\n \\n lina suit. The North Carolina Supreme Court met these claims. It met them by saying that the North Carolina statute did not deal with substantive matters but merely with matters regulating local procedure. But whether the claims are based on a federal right or are merely of local concern is itself a federal question on which this Court, and not the Supreme Court of North Carolina, has the last say. That Court could not put a federal claim aside, as though it were not in litigation, by the talismanic word 'jurisdiction'. When an asserted federal right is denied, the sufficiency of the grounds of denial is for this Court to decide. Titus v. Wallick, \\n306 \\nU.S. 282, 291\\n, 59 S.Ct. 557, 562. Bullington could have come here, not merely by the grace of this Court on certiorari, but on appeal, as did White in White v. Hart, supra, to challenge, successfully, the right of Georgia to limit the jurisdiction of the Georgia courts; as did the East New York Savings Bank in the recent case of East New York Sav. Bank v. Hahn, \\n326 \\nU.S. 230\\n, 66 S.Ct. 69, 160 A.L.R. 1279, to challenge, though unsuccessfully, the limitation which New York placed upon the jurisdiction of its courts. Cf. Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \\n252 \\nU.S. 411, 416\\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 372, 10 A.L.R. 716. Since it was open for Bullington to come here to seek reversal of the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court shutting him out of the North Carolina courts and he chose not to do so, the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded an adjudication of a federal question even though it was not couched in those terms. For purposes of litigating the issues in controversy in the North Carolina action, the North Carolina Supreme Court was an intermediate tribunal. If a litigant chooses not to continue to assert his rights after an intermediate tribunal has decided against him, he has concluded his litigation as effectively as though he had proceeded through the highest tribunal available to him. An adjudication of an issue implies that a man had a chance to win his case. The chance was necessarily afforded by the North Carolina litigation. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 190]\\n \\n It was in process of determination when the Supreme Court of North Carolina decided against him. He forewent his right to have a higher court, this Court, enable him to win his chance by holding that he was right and that the North Carolina Supreme Court was wrong. He cannot begin all over again in an action involving the same issues before another forum in the same State.\\n\\n 5. \\nIt is suggested that the North Carolina Supreme Court did not adjudicate the 'merits' of the controversy. It is a misconception of res judicata to assume that the doctrine does not come into operation if a court has not passed on the 'merits' in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation. An adjudication declining to reach such ultimate substantive issues may bar a second attempt to reach them in another court of the State. Such a situation is presented when the first decision is based not on the ground that the distribution of judicial power among the various courts of the State requires the suit to be brought in another court in the State, but on the inaccessibility of all the courts of the State to such litigation. And that is the essence of the present case. The only issue in controversy in the first North Carolina litigation was whether or not all the courts of North Carolina were closed to that litigation. The merits of that issue were adjudicated. And that was the issue raised in the second litigation in North Carolina-that in the federal district court. The merits of this issue having been adjudicated, they cannot be relitigated.\\n The 'merits' of a claim are disposed of when hey are refused enforcement. If an asserted federal claim is denied enforcement on a professed local ground, but a so-called local ground which is subject to review here because it is in fact the adjudication of a federal question, then the 'merits' of that claim were adjudicated in the only sense that adjudication of the 'merits' is relevant to the principles of res judicata. A State court can- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 191]\\n \\n not sterilize federal claims by putting on the adjudication a locl label.\\n\\n 6. \\nThe merits of this controversy were adjudicated by the North Carolina Supreme Court since that court, or this Court on appeal, might have decided that the North Carolina statute did not bar Bullington's first action. The North Carolina statute might have been found unconstitutional. Federal issues were thus involved in the adjudication by the North Carolina Supreme Court. Bullington knew that there were federal issues in the State suit because he raised them. He was then content to drop them and let the intermediate adjudication stand. Now he wants an encore.\\n\\n 7. \\nIt is suggested that the North Carolina Supreme Court construed the North Carolina statute to close only the North Carolina State courts but not the federal court sitting in North Carolina. In the first place, the North Carolina Supreme Court said no such thing. It construed the statute expressive of State policy and spoke only of the jurisdiction of the State courts because it was concerned only with the State courts. Secondly, it is most incongruous to attribute to the legislature and judiciary of North Carolina the imposition of a restriction against all its citizens from suing for a deficiency judgment, while impliedly authorizing citizens of other States to secure such deficiency judgments against North Carolinians. Thirdly, a North Carolina statute, upheld by the highest court of North Carolina, is of course expressive of North Carolina policy. The essence of diversity jurisdiction is that a federal court enforces State law and State policy. If North Carolina has authoritatively announced that deficiency judgments cannot be secured within its borders, it contradicts the presuppositions of diversity jurisdiction for a federal court in that State to give such a deficiency judgment. North Carolina would hardly allow defeat of a State-wide policy through occasional suits in a federal \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 192]\\n \\n court. What is more important, diversity jurisdiction must follow State law and policy. A federal court in North Carolina, when invoked on grounds of diversity of citizenship, cannot give that which North Carolina has withheld. Availability of diversity jurisdiction which was put into the Constitution so as to prevent discrimination against outsiders is not to effect discrimination against the great body of local citizens.\\n Cases like David Lupton's Sons v. Automobile Club of America, \\n225 \\nU.S. 489\\n, 32 S.Ct. 711, Ann.Cas.1914A, 699, are obsolete insofar as they are based on a view of diversity jurisdiction which came to an end with Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \\n304 \\nU.S. 64\\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487. That decision drastically limited the power of federal district courts to entertain suits in diversity cases that could not be brought in the respective State courts or were barred by defenses controlling in the State courts. Compare Suydam v. Broadnax, 14 Pet. 67, 75. Of course, where resort is had to a federal court not on grounds of diversity of citizenship but because a federal right is claimed, the limitations upon the courts of a State do not control a federal court sitting in the State. Holmberg v. Armbrecht, \\n327 \\nU.S. 392\\n, 66 S.Ct. 582, 162 A.L.R. 719.\\n\\n 8. \\nAfter an adverse decision against Bullington on a cause of action created by State law, Bullington wants to start all over again in another North Carolina court, albeit a federal court. The first litigation raised and adjudicated federal issues every one of which is again involved in the second suit. To allow such a second suit i to say that a federal right in issue in a State court evaporates because the State court calls it a State right and the litigant accepts the decision. If tolerated, our federal system would afford fine opportunities for needlessly multiplying litigation in this way. The doctrine of res judicata is a barrier against it. Litigation is the means for vindicating rights, but it may also involve unwarranted friction and waste. The doctrine of res judicata reflects the refusal of law to toler- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 193]\\n \\n ate needless litigation. Litigation is needless if, by fair process, a controversy has once gone through the courts to conclusion. Compare, e.g., Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford Empire Co., \\n322 \\nU.S. 238, 244\\n, 64 S.Ct. 997, 1000. And it has gone through, if issues that were or could have been dealt with in an earlier litigation are raised anew between the same parties. Chicot County Drainage Dist. v. Baxter State Bank, \\n308 \\nU.S. 371\\n, 60 S.Ct. 317.\\n Judgment reversed.\\n\\n Mr. Justice REED, dissenting.\\n My understanding of the Court's decision is that the doctrine of res judicata, that is a former adjudication, defeats Bullington's claim against Angel. The opinion is limited to that point. In my view the conclusion reached by the Court is erroneous. To narrow the line of my disagreement, I shall state the issues treated in the opinion with which I agree. The causes of action and the parties in the two suits are identical. Federal questions were raised by Bullington's contention that the North Carolina statute, sufficiently quoted at the beginning of the Court's opinion, Mitchie's Code, 2593(f), was unconstitutional by federal tests because it barred the North Carolina courts to Bullington's suit on his notes. It is immaterial, for the purposes of determining the availability of a plea of res judicata, whether the North Carolina judgment was erroneous or not. I agree, further, that, on the ground that a state cannot bar this cause of action from its courts, Bullington could have had review in this Court of the North Carolina judgment and that this Court, if it did not conclude that the North Carolina judgment rested on an adequate state ground, could have finally settled that federal constitutional issue.\\n The reasoning of the Court leads to the announced result because of these presuppositions with which I differ: (I) 'For purposes of res judicata, the significance of what a court says it decides is controlled by the issues that \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 194]\\n \\n were open for decision.' (II) 'The 'merits' of a claim are disposed of when they are refused enforcement.' (III) 'Since it was open for Bullington to come here to seek reversal of the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court shutting him out of the North Carolina courts and he chose not to do so, the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded an adjudication of a federal question even though it was not couched in those terms.' (IV) 'For purposes of diversity jurisdiction of federal court is 'in effect, only another court of the State.\" 'He cannot begin all over again in an action involving the same issues before another forum in the same State.'\\n I. To say that for purposes of res judicata the significance of what a court says it decides is controlled by the issues, announces a rule which, so far as I know, has no prior authority. To adopt such a rule is to declare that a decision in a cause of action is final between the same parties although the court specifically reserves certain questions not necessary for its decision. Res judicata settles all questions which were raised or those that might have been raised but it settles them in accordance with the decision that is made. Of course, when a decision is upon the merits, a matter discussed later, the entire cause of action is adjudicated finally. But this North Carolina adjudication was not upon the merits. It was upon a question of judicial power. The pertinent excerpts from the opinion appear below. \\n1\\n The fact that other \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 195]\\n \\n issues, going to the merits of the cause of action, might have been decided seems immaterial.\\n The rule which I consider sound appears in the Restatement of the Law, Judgments  49, as follows:\\n'Where a valid and final personal judgment not on the merits is rendered in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff is not thereby precluded from thereafter maintaining an action on the original cause of action and the judgment is conclusive only as to what is actually decided.'\\n\\n The way to know what was actually decided in this case is to read the applicable portion of the opinion printed in the preceding note. The result of the decision was to leave the cause of action unaffected because when a state denies a remedy, it leaves 'unimpaired the plaintiff's substantive right, so that he is free to enforce it elsewhere.' Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \\n286 \\nU.S. 145, 160\\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 576, 82 A.L.R. 696; Dalton v. Webster, 82 N.C. 279. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 196]\\n \\n II. It is now to be considered whether or not this judgment of the state court was on the merits. That court said it had no 'power to render a judgment for the plaintiff in the cause of action alleged.' This Court now says that such a decision is a disposition on the merits. Eviently what is meant is that when a litigant, who has raised a federal constitutional question, has his case dismissed on the ground that the court 'has no power to render a judgment for the plaintiff in the cause of action alleged,' there is a judgment on the merits on the constitutional question as well as upon the right to recover in North Carolina on any other ground. If we have power to declare that it 'concluded an adjudication of a federal question even though it professed not to do so,' I would reach the opposite conclusion based upon what the North Carolina court did. In my view, the North Carolina court merely decided that it had no power to adjudicate the cause of action. Certainly the state court had the power to interpret its own statute. Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias, v. Meyer, \\n265 \\nU.S. 30, 32\\n, 44 S.Ct. 432, 433; Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, \\n315 \\nU.S. 568\\n, 62 S.Ct. 766. The withdrawal of jurisdiction surely does not make a judgment one upon the merits. The state court cited x parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, to emphasize what it meant. If there was a suit on this note in a federal court on an allegation of diversity of citizenship and the federal court dismissed the suit with an opinion saying that the case was dismissed because of lack of jurisdiction, e.g. proof of non-diversity of citizenship, no state court would hold that there had been a decision upon the merits. Where there is no jurisdiction of the subject of the action the judgment is not upon the merits. Stoll v. Gottlieb, \\n305 \\nU.S. 165, 171\\n, 172 S., 59 S.Ct. 134, 137, 138. Of course, if there is a judgment upon the merits, that judgment would be binding on both federal and state courts. Even if the North Carolina decision is not upon the merits, it is conclusive on North Carolina courts and upon federal courts in North Carolina, \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 197]\\n \\n if those federal courts are courts of the State of North Carolina in the sense that they must follow state decisions upon the power of state courts, under the rule of Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \\n326 \\nU.S. 99\\n, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 160 A.L.R. 1231. I do not think that the guaranty rule applies. See subdivision IV.\\n III. If the two preceding numbered divisions of this opinion are sound, there was no occasion for Bullington to seek a review of the first judgment in this Court. He was in the position of the owner of a cause of action, dismissed because prematurely brought or brought in the wrong county. The judgment that the Supreme Court of North Carolina ordered was 'dismissed' not on the merits, not with prejudice, and not judgment for the defendant, but a simple dismissal. North Carolina might have declared, by statute, that no cause of action would be recognized in North Carolina for the recovery of a deficiency on a mortgage indebtedness. Instead of this, we are told, authoritatively, by the Supreme Court of North Carolina that North Carolina has withdrawn the jurisdiction of its courts from such a cause of action. This produces quite a different situation.\\n IV. The pith of the problem, as I see it, is laid bare by the foregoing differentiations. It consists of the question whether the North Carolina decision establishes a controlling rule of law upon the constitutionality of the state statute as tested by the federal Constitution or adjudicates that the statute merely withdraws jurisdiction from state courts over a type of action. This Court concludes that the state decision determined the constitutionality of the statute and that its holding was binding on all federal courts in North Carolina, as well as state courts. This idea is comprehended in the Court's opinion by the statements that the federal courts are courts of the state in diversity cases and that a litigant cannot stop with an intermediate court decision against him and begin a new litigation on the same cause of action. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 198]\\n \\n The Court reaches the conclusion that res judicata should apply by an application of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, \\n304 \\nU.S. 64\\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487, and Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \\n326 \\nU.S. 99\\n, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 160 A.L.R. 1231. The teaching of those cases is accepted by me. They lead to the conclusion that in diversity cases, legal or equitable, and this proceeding is a diversity case, the federal courts in a state apply the law of that state in matters of substantive law. In matters of procedure and jurisdiction, I take it, no one would contend that the doctrine of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins is applicable. One may regret that the line of the Great Divide between substance and procedure cannot be clearly marked so that all may agree as to its location in any one case. But that line exists. We have said that federal courts must follow the law of the state as to burden of proof. Cities Service Oil Co. v. Dunlap, \\n308 \\nU.S. 208\\n, 60 S.Ct. 201; Palmer v. Hoffman, \\n318 \\nU.S. 109, 117\\n, 63 S.Ct. 477, 482, 144 A.L.R. 719; as to conflict of laws, Griffin v. McCoach \\n313 \\nU.S. 498\\n, 61 S. Ct. 1023, 134 A.L.R. 1462; Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., \\n313 \\nU.S. 487\\n, 61 S.Ct. 1020, and as to state statutes of limitation in equity cases, Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra. The reason for these conclusions is to gain the desirable end of a symmetry of law within each state. The momentum of the opinions, just cited, and of the desire for unifrmity should not cause us to disregard the rule that state law, statutory or judicial, directed at remedies or powers of courts, cannot affect the federal system. Each of the cases just cited follows the declarations of state law by state courts. In this case, this Court departs from the state court's interpretation of the meaning of a state statute in order to bring about the federal policy of uniformity. By this, the Court departs from the sound rule that a state court's interpretation of state statutes is binding on federal courts. In reaching the conclusion which it does, this Court decides that if a state court does not have power to adjudicate a cause, neither does a federal court in that state. It also departs from controlling precedents that state enactments on jurisdic- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 199]\\n \\n tion, remedies and procedures do not affect the jurisdiction, remedies or procedures of federal courts. It is true that these antedate the Erie case but that case did not change the state and federal jurisdiction.\\n In Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \\n261 \\nU.S. 491\\n, 43 S.Ct. 454, 456, this Court held that an authority given by Delaware to its Chancellor to appoint a receiver for an insolvent corporation on the application of any creditor did not give additional power to the federal court to appoint a receiver in a diversity case on the application of a simple creditor although the federal courts had long exercised the right to appoint receivers on the application of a secured creditor. This Court said:\\n'That a remedial right to proceed in a federal court sitting in equity cannot be enlarged by a state statute is likewise clear, Scott v. Neely, \\n140 \\nU.S. 106\\n, 11 S.Ct. 712; Cates v. Allen, \\n149 \\nU.S. 451\\n, 13 S.Ct. 883, 977. Nor can it be so narrowed. Mississippi Mills v. Cohn, \\n150 \\nU.S. 202\\n, 14 S.Ct. 75; Guffey v. Smith, \\n237 \\nU.S. 101, 114\\n, 35 S.Ct. 526, (530,) 59 L.Ed. 856. The federal court may therefore be obliged to deny an equitable remedy which the plaintiff might have secured in a state court. Hanssen's contention is that the statute does not enlarge the equitable jurisdiction or remedies, and that it confers upon creditors of a Delaware corporation, if the company is insolvent, a substantive equitable right to have a receiver appointed. If this were true the right conferred could be enforced in the federal courts (Scott v. Neely, \\n140 \\nU.S. 106, 109\\n, 11 S.Ct. 712, (713,) 35 L.Ed. 358), since the proceeding is in pleading and practice conformable to those commonly entertained by a court of equity. But it is not true that this statute confers upon the creditor a substantive right.'\\n\\n See Henrietta Mills v. Rutherford County, \\n291 \\nU.S. 121, 127\\n, 128 S., 50 S.Ct. 270, 272, 273; Kelleam v. Maryland Casualty Co., \\n312 \\nU.S. 377, 382\\n, 61 S.Ct. 595, 598. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 200]\\n \\n In David Lupton's Sons v. Automobile Club of America, \\n225 \\nU.S. 489\\n, 32 S.Ct. 711, Ann.Cas.1914A, 699, this Court held, that a contract which could not be sued upon in the courts of New York because a New York statute provided that no foreign corporation could 'maintain any action in this state' without a certificate that it had complied with certain state requirements to do business in the state, could nevertheless be sued upon in the federal court. It was said, 225 U.S. at page 500, 32 S. Ct. at page 714:\\n'The state could not prescribe the qualifications of suitors in the courts of the United States, and could not deprive of their privileges those who were entitled under the Constitution and laws of the United States to resort to the Fede al courts for the enforcement of a valid contract. ... The state in the statute before us made no such attempt. The only penalty is imposed, to quote again from the Mahar Case (Mahar v. Harrington Park Villa Sites, 204 N.Y. 231, 97 N.E. 587, 38 L.R.A.,N.S., 210), was a disability to sue 'in the courts of New York.\"\\n\\n These cases make clear that in diversity litigation the federal courts are not simply courts of the state. They are so far as the enforcement of the substantive laws of the state are concerned, but not when procedure or power to act is involved. The Lupton case shows too, that when a state denies power to its courts to adjudicate a cause, that denial does not affect the power of the federal courts to decide the case. As I am of the opinion that the state court merely denied its power to adjudge between these parties and did not decide the merits of Bullington's cause of action, the state court judgment cannot be res judicata in the federal court.\\n If it is true that in passing upon the meaning of a state statute, a federal court is not required to follow the state court's characterization of its statute, as remedial or substantive, this Court's present determination that the statute is substantive for our purposes cannot change the effect in this litigation of the state's decision to the contrary. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 201]\\n \\n When the state court held that for its purposes the statute was remedial, it was remedial in that court. If remedial, the state judgment was not upon the merits and could not be res judicata in any court as to the right to recover on the cause of action.\\n If the plea of res judicata is not good and this Court should decide that the state statute is substantive law, i.e., a declaration of the policy of North Carolina against claims on deficiencies after sales of incumbered property, it would be necessary to determine the constitutionality of the North Carolina statute that declares uncollectible in North Carolina a claim on a contract that was good in Virginia. In view of this Court's present decision, I express no opinion upon this issue.\\n Mr. Justice JACKSON and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE join in this opinion.\\n\\n Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE, dissenting.\\n This is a hard case making, I think, proverbially bad law. On the surface what seems to be decided is simply a question of res judicata. Actually the decision rests on an 'and/or' hodgepodge of res judicata and Erie doctrines. 1 In my judgment the admixture not only is unnecessary but distorts and misapplies both doctrines. If res judicata properly applies and is adequate to dispose of the cause, there is no occasion for the sidewise introduction of Erie ideas. Likewise, if Erie appropriately governs the case, the Court's elaborate and altogether novel discussion of res judicata is superfluous.\\n The Court has not decided this case on any basis of full faith and credit. 2 Accordingly res judicata as it is applied \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 202]\\n \\n has neither constitutional nor statutory status. For present purposes it is therefore purely a rule of judicial administration to be applied, like all such rules, as considerations of justice and right application of the policy require, not omitting due regard for its appropriate limits.\\n Res judicata is a generally sound but by no means unlimited policy of judicial action. The doctrine is grounded in the need for putting an end to litigation. 3 It does this by precluding the parties from showing what is or may be the truth. \\n4\\n The sound core of the policy is that ordinarily one suit which determines or gives a full and fair chance \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 203]\\n \\n for determining causes of action and issues5 between litigants should be enough and when this much has been given further opportunity should be denied.\\n Stated so simply, however, the doctrine would be as much trap for the unwary as boon for the wise or lucky litigant. Exceptions and qualifications are so numerous as to make the field not only technical but treacherous, this case being a nice illustration. Qualification may itself lose sight of basic policy and become sheer technicality. \\n6\\n But general rules are not qualified so extensively as this one has been without reason. There is good reason for much of what has been done in this respect with res judicata.\\n The effect of the rule qualifies its scope. It is not every case in which a litigant has had 'one bite at the cherry' that the law forbids another. In other words, it is not every such case in which the policy of stopping litigation outweighs that of showing the truth. This is so not only where the first suit actually gives no real chance to secure a substantial determination, 7 but also though less generally of others in which the litigant has such a chance and foregoes or misses it. \\n8\\n It is so too whether the claimed \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 204]\\n \\n estoppel by prior suit is 'direct' or 'indirect,' that is, on the same or a different cause of action. \\n9\\n \\n\\n Upon the law as well as the policy, the question has been one of balancing considerations of justice and convenience between stopping litigation and stopping the showing of the truth. \\n10\\n That balance has never been so one-sided in favor of the former that the matter is ended simply by showing that a party has had some chance, however slight, in a previous litigation to secure a favorable decision.\\n If this were the law every case where a party takes a nonsuit or a dismissal expressly for the purpose of starting over again would be a final and conclusive determination against him. I know of no jurisdiction where the law has been so harsh. Nor do I think it should be in this one.\\n There are too many good reasons why persons starting out in litigation should not be barred of their rights by the fact alone that they withdraw in order to start again, even though by going on to the end they might pull through successfully against great odds. Crucial witnesses may disappear or die and time be required for finding them or others. Surprise in the course of trial may occur justifying withdrawal without fatal loss of rights. Even as in \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 205]\\n \\n this case, jurisdictional and other uncertainties may arise putting in jeopardy or making comparatively or completely futile further pursuit of the pending litigation when another suit in the same or a different court might provide a more certain and less expensive mode of disposing of the controversy for all the parties.\\n These and other reasons have qualified flat application of res judicata too long and too universally for their qualifying effects to be thrown overboard now simply because a withdrawing litigant might conceivably have come out victorious had he gone on to the very farthest end. \\n11\\n Such a criterion would turn res judicata into a rigid rule requiring exhaustion of judicial remedies, a notion heretofore wholly alien to the doctrine. \\n12\\n \\n\\n This course, moreover, seems to be justified on the basis that the grounds of an adjudication have nothing to do with the adjudication or its effects for purposes of applying res judicata. That is true, apparently, for applying res judicata to Bullington's failure to take his appeal here in the North Carolina state court suit, so as to cut off his right ever to secure a decision on the \"merits' in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation.' But it is not true apparently, for application of the doctrine to different jurisdictional rulings. For 'an adjudication declining to reach such ultimate substantive issues may bar a second attempt to reach them in another court of the \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 206]\\n \\n State. Such a situation is presented when the first decision is based not on the ground that the distribution of judicial power among the various courts of the State requires the suit to be brought in another court in the State, but on the inaccessibility of all the courts of the State to such litigation. And that is the essence of the present case.' (Emphasis added.)\\n I can understand the distinction drawn. But I find difficulty in understanding why res judicata turns for application in this case to cut off determination of substantive issues not at all upon the grounds of decision but only on the fact of adverse decision; but, for application to such issues when a jurisdictional question is also involved, it turns not simply upon the adjudication, but upon the grounds for the jurisdictional determination. If res judicata is governed solely by the adjudication without reference to what is adjudicated, that is, merely by the fact of adverse decision, I should think that rule would apply in all cases. If, on the contrary, the grounds of adjudication are relevant and controlling for the one class of questions, I should think they would be for the other.\\n The fallacy lies in the novel and unprecedented idea that the groundings of a court's decision have nothing to do with whether res judicata applies, except when they relate to one kind of jurisdictional determination rather than another. Apart from the exception, the idea ignores the vast body of law which has grown up on the basis that the grounding of the decision is the criterion for applying the doctrine. \\n13\\n And much of that case law has been that if the \"merits' in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation' are not reached, their later determination is not foreclosed. \\n14\\n This is true whether or not the jurisdic- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 207]\\n \\n tional ruling is erroneous or valid and whether or not if erroneous it might have been corrected on appeal.\\n That law I think is sound, and I think it is just as sound when the jurisdictional decision goes off erroneously on a federal ground or erroneously ignoring one as when it rests on a valid basis. It is grounded in the policy that unless a litigant gets a real bite at the apple of discord he should not be foreclosed from another attempt. Its basis is that in such a case it is better and more just not to stop litigation than it is to stop the showing of the truth and thereby bring about a forfeiture of valuable substantive rights without giving at least one full and fair, which means fairly certain, opportunity for securing decision upon them.\\n Bullington has not had such an opportunity. He has never received, and now never can receive a decision on the substantive merits of his claim, unless possibly he can catch and serve Angel in another state and after prolonged further litigation succeed in inducing this Court to hold the North Carolina bar and res judicata not operative there. See Riley v. New York Trust Co., \\n315 \\nU.S. 343, 349\\n, 62 S.Ct. 608, 612: 'By the Constitutional provision for full faith and credit, the local doctrines of res judicata, speaking generally, become a part of national jurisprudence, and therefore federal questions cognizable here.'\\n Conceivably Bullington by coming here in the North Carolina suit might have secured a decision that the North Carolina statute and decision were invalid constitutionally in excluding him from all the state's courts and that the state must afford him a remedy on proof of his substantive claim. But the very multiplicity of the constitutional questions enumerated in the Court's opinion which were or might have been pertinent made that chance slim indeed. What is more important is that i the judgment had been thus reversed and remanded, it would have been \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 208]\\n \\n wiped out and he then would have been free to dismiss the suit and start over again in the federal courts sitting in the state or in the state courts. Bucher v. Cheshire R. Co., \\n125 \\nU.S. 555, 578\\n, 579 S., 8 S.Ct. 974, 975, 976.15\\n On the other hand, if the case had gone against him here, then his right to start over in the federal court in North Carolina would depend upon whether one of two grounds were accepted for this Court's decision, namely, on the one hand, that North Carolina had power to bar his substantive claim and had done so in effect though not in words, thus closing the doors of the federal court to it under the Erie rule; on the other, that the state had power to close its courts against his claim without adjudicating its substantive validity, thus leaving him free to go to the federal court under the Erie rule. Either result was a conceivable one, depending on whether the Court should conclude that a 'right without a remedy' remains a right, for this purpose, or becomes none at all. But the only chance for Bullington's ultimate success, in the event of adverse deci- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 209]\\n \\n sion here, would have been for the decision to have turned out on the latter ground.\\n That chance was hardly worth the gamble. For this Court has declared in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, \\n326 \\nU.S. 99, 108\\n, 109 S., 65 S.Ct. 1464, 1469, 1470, 160 A.L.R. 1231, that a right without a remedy is no right at all for purposes of enforcement by a diversity suit in a federal court sitting in the state. \\n16\\n And the nature of the North Carolina statute as construed by the state court reaches exactly the result which the York case says precludes resort to the federal court on the same cause in a diversity suit. 17 Indeed this seems to be an alternative basis for the present decision. 18 Buillington's chance to get to the federal court on such a basis was therefore practically nil.\\n Should he now be barred because he did not take the extremely remote chance of securing a favorable decision, reversing the state court's judgment and forcing the state to hear his case on the merits? Not, I think, unless we can say he then would have been forced, if successful, to continue the litigation in the state courts and could not withdraw to start over in the North Carolina federal court. This we could not say unles we were to overrule the Bucher case, which Bullington had a right to assume we would not do. Why he should be barred from doing now, because he did not take his almost hopeless appeal, what he would have been at liberty to do if he had taken it successfully, I am not able to understand. No sound policy of ending litigation, conserving judicial time or litigants' rights or in any other respect can possibly be served by \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 210]\\n \\n such a ruling. \\n19\\n Moreover, the very difficulties in his way for securing a successful determination here, which would give him some certain remedy either in the state or in the federal courts, were sufficient reason, in my opinion, to justify his foregoing that dubious procedure and starting over again in the federal court.\\n The real trouble here is not with the law of res judicata, for that law has no valid application to these facts. It is that the doctrine is used as an escape from facing squarely the real question presented. This is whether North Carolina's decision made the Erie doctrine applicable. The Court's opinion does state expressly that the effect of the North Carolina decision was to create a policy of the state against the validity of all claims for deficiency judgments, and comes almost but not quite to saying this requires the case to go off on application of the York rule.\\n That issue is inescapable here. The Erie rule did not purport to change the law of federal jurisdiction in diversity cases, taking it out of the hands of Congress and the federal courts and putting it within the states' power to determine. It purported only to prescribe the rule federal courts should follow in applying the substantive law. If the North Carolina decision was exclusively a jurisdic- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 183, 211]\\n \\n tional one, it had no effect on the power of the federal courts in that state to hear controversies excluded by it from the state courts, and the decision neither reached the merits of the controversy 'in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation' nor barred Bullington from going to the federal court. See David Lupton's Sons v. Automobile Club, \\n225 \\nU.S. 489\\n, 32 S.Ct. 711, Ann.Cas.1914A 699. If on the other hand the decision was in effect, although not in words, a determination of the merits in that sense, if both adjudicated Bullington's substantive rights and barred him from maintaining the later suit successfully in the federal court. That question is here and until it is resolved he is deprived of any day in court except to go from one to another without securing decision either on the merits substantially or 'on the merits' jurisdictionally.\\n From the Court's opinion I cannot say whether the question has been resolved. Its discussion of North Carolina's 'policy' and its overruling of the Lupton's Sons case, supra, would seem to indicate that it is applying York, though without saying so frankly. But, if so, why speak also of res judicata? The law should not be made into such a merry-go- round. Bullington is entitled to one full day in court on the substance of his claim. This he has not had.\\n I hardly need add that I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Reed.\\n Mr. Justice JACKSON joins in this opinion. \\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] 220 N.C. at pages 20, 21, 16 S.E.2d at page 412, 136 A.L.R. 1054: 'The statute operates upon the adjective law of the state, which pertains to the practice and procedure, or legal machinery by which the substantive law is made effective, and not upon the substantive law itself. It is a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.\\n'The legislature, within constitutional limitations, can fix and circumscribe the jurisdiction of the courts of this state. The legislature has exercised its prerogative to so limit the jurisdiction of the courts of this state that holders of notes given for purchase price of real estate are not entitled to a deficiency judgment thereon in such courts. We cannot hold that this action upon part of the legislative branch of our government impinged the full faith and credit clause of the constitution of the United States, Art. 4,  1, or the general doctrine that the validity of a contract is determined by the law of the place where made, the lex loci contractus as distinguished from the lex fori. Both the constitutional provision urged and the general doctrine invoked by the appellee are substantive law and the statute involved, as aforesaid, relates solely to the adjective law. No denial of the full force and credit of the Virginia contract is made, and no interpretation or construction of the contract involved is attempted. The court, being deprived of its jurisdiction, has no power to render a judgment for the plaintiff in the cause of action alleged. 'Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause. And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle.\" \\n\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, \\n304 \\nU.S. 64\\n, 58 S.Ct. 817, 114 A.L.R. 1487. \\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] The Court does not hold that the full faith and credit clause, Const., Art. IV,  1, binds the federal courts to give the North Carolina judgment the effect of precluding a further suit in the federal courts on the substantive cause of action. Two difficulties would arise. (1) If, as the Court asserts, the federal court in diversity cases were only 'another North Carolina court,' the full faith and credit clause would have no application; but, that it may, see Cooper v. Newell, \\n173 \\nU.S. 555, 567\\n, 19 S.Ct. 506, 510: '... the courts of the United States are tribunals of a different sovereignty, and exercise a distinct and independent jurisdiction from that exercised by the state courts; a d this is true in respect of the courts of the several States, as between each other. And the courts of the United States are bound to give to the judgments of the state courts the same faith and credit that the courts of one state and bound to give to the judgments of the courts of her sister states.' See also American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, \\n287 \\nU.S. 156\\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 86 A.L.R. 298, where Mr. Justice Brandeis spoke of the full faith and credit clause in connection with the obligation of a federal court sitting in Idaho to follow, as res judicata, a previous Idaho decision. (2) The decision would contradict, not confirm, as full faith and credit require, the basis for the North Carolina court's judgment, namely, that the statute does not outlaw substantive claims but only deprives the state courts of power to entertain them. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 3\\n] See Moschzisker, Res Judicata (1929) 38 Yale L.J. 299, 300. In this respect, of course, res judicata resembles both statutes of limitations and the doctrine of laches in equity, as well as full faith and credit when applicable to judgments. \\n[\\nFootnote 4\\n] Scott, Collateral Estoppel by Judgment (1942) 56 Harv.L.Rev. 1.

And 'generally speaking, judgments merely of dismissal, whether voluntary or involuntary, in actions at law are not on the merits and do not operate as a bar or estoppel is subsequent proceedings involving the same matters.'

Usually 'direct' estoppel is said to preclude redetermination of issues actually determined or which might have been determined 'on the merits.' Ibid.

But the ruling as made, in so far as it rests on the failure to appeal ignores the settled law that for purposes of applying res judicata failure to take appeal has no bearing once the judgment becomes final. See note 19. It also defeats the policy of res judicata; for a party, instead of being allowed to accept the jurisdictional ruling, is forced to appeal to the highest court in order to save his rights no matter how meritless the appeal, thus prolonging rather than shortening litigation. \\n[\\nFootnote 12\\n] See note 19. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 13\\n] See Scott, op. cit., supra note 4; Restatement, Judgments (1942)  49, 50, 53, 54. \\n[\\nFootnote 14\\n] See authorities cited in note 7 supra. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 15\\n] 'If ... a judgment has been vacated by the trial court or reversed by an appellate court, it is no longer conclusive between the parties, either as a merger of the original cause of action or as a bar to an action upon the original cause of action. ...' Restatement, Judgments ( 1942) 163.\\n'Ordinarily, after a judgment has been reversed on appeal and the cause remanded, the case stands for trial de novo on the issues properly joined. ... With respect to the right of plaintiff to take a voluntary nonsuit, it stands in the same relative position which it occupied before the trial in the first instance.' Shell Petroleum Corp. v. Shore, 10 Cir., 80 F.2d 785, 786.\\n\\n This is the general rule. 89 A.L.R. 109; 126 A.L.R. 305. It would seem to apply in North Carolina. North Carolina follows both the doctrine that the trial court, upon remand by an appellate court, is to proceed as if there had been no previous trial and the doctrine that judgments not on the merits do not constitute an estoppel to subsequent actions. Hickory v. Southern R., 138 N.C. 311, 318, 50 S.E. 683; Grimes v. Andrews, 170 N.C. 515, 87 S.E. 341; cf. Gen.Stat.N.C. (1943)  1-25, as interpreted in Grimes v. Andrews, 170 N.C. at page 522, 87 S.E. at page 344. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 16\\n] The York case however did not purport to apply or extend the rule to a cause of action arising under and governed by the laws of another state than that in which the federal court was sitting. But cf. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., \\n313 \\nU.S. 487\\n, 61 S.Ct. 1020. \\n[\\nFootnote 17\\n] Except for the factor noted in Note 16. \\n[\\nFootnote 18\\n] See text infra. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 19\\n] 'The application of the principle of res judicata has not in any way been made to depend upon whether the judgment in question is subject to review in another tribunal. Except in so far as it may affect the question of its finality, as in the case of orders on motions, the fact that a judgment may or may not be appealable should have no bearing upon its effect as res judicata.' 2 Freeman, Judgments (5th ed.) 1339.\\n Thus, there is no doctrine of exhaustion of judicial remedies. If the judgment of a court goes on jurisdictional grounds, the party may accept it and, instead of appealing, may institute another action where he will not be met by the jurisdictional bar. Cf.

WEST VIRGINIA PULP & PAPER CO.(1947)\\nNo. 184\\nArgued: February 3, 1947Decided: March 3, 1947\\n\\n\\n\\n Motion to Amend Mandate Denied June 16, 1947\\n\\n\\n See \\n331 \\nU.S. 794\\n, 67 S.Ct. 1725.\\n Messrs. H. Wayne Unger, of Walterboro, S.C., and James P. Mozingo, of Darlington, S.C., for petitioner.\\n Messrs. Christie Benet, of Columbia, S.C., and Charles W. Waring of Charleston, S.C., for respondent.\\n\\n Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n The petitioner brought this action in a South Carolina state court. Upon motion of respondent, it was removed to the Federal District Court because of diversity \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 213]\\n \\n of citizenship of the parties. The complaint claimed $25,000 damages upon allegations that the respondent's agents had trespassed upon and cut timber from lands owned by and in the possession of the petitioner. Respondent's answer denied that the petitioner had title or possession of the lands and timbers. Both title and possession became crucial issues in the trial. The burden of proving them rested on the petitioner. \\n1\\n When all the evidence of both parties had been introduced, the respondent moved for a directed verdict in its favor on the ground that the petitioner had failed to prove that he either owned or was in possession of the land. \\n2\\n This motion was denied. The jury returned a verdict for petitioner for $15, 000, and the court entered judgment on the verdict. The respondent moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. This motion was denied. Respondent did not move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as it might have done under Rule 50(b) of the \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 214]\\n \\n Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is set out below. \\n3\\n \\n\\n The Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the admission of certain evidence offered by the petitioner to prove legal title was prejudicial error. It held that without this improperly admitted evidence petitioner's proof was not sufficient to submit the question of title to the jury. That court also held that petitioner's evidence showing possession was insufficient to go to the jury. It therefore reversed the case. But instead of remanding it to the District Court for a new trial, the Circuit Court of Appeals directed that judgment be entered for respondent. That court has thus construed Rule 50(b) as authorizing an appellate court to direct a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, even though no motion for such a judgment had been made in the District Court within ten days after the jury's discharge.\\n The petition for certiorari challenged the power of an appellate court to direct entry of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict where timely motion for such a judg- \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 215]\\n \\n ment had not been made in the District Court. On three previous occasions we have granted certiorari to consider this point but failed to reach it because, upon examination of the evidence, we found it sufficient to justify submission of all three cases to the jury. Conway v. O'Brien, \\n312 \\nU.S. 492\\n, 61 S.Ct. 634; Berry v. United States, \\n312 \\nU.S. 450\\n, 61 S.Ct. 637; Halliday v. United States, \\n315 \\nU.S. 94\\n, 62 S. Ct. 438. In this case we granted certiorari 'limited to the questions of federal procedure raised by the petition for the writ.' \\n329 \\nU.S. 701\\n, 67 S.Ct. 57. The point we had in mind was whether a party's failure to make a motion in th District Court for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, as permitted in Rule 50(b), precludes an appellate court from directing entry of such a judgment. Other questions have been discussed here, but we do not consider them. Consequently, we accept, without approving or disapproving, the Circuit Court of Appeals' holding that there was prejudicial error in the admission of evidence and in the submission of the case to the jury.\\n Rule 50(b) contains no language which absolutely requires a trial court to enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict even though that court is persuaded that it erred in failing to direct a verdict for the losing party. The rule provides that the trial court 'may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed.' This 'either-or' language means what it seems to mean, namely, that there are circumstances which might lead the trial court to believe that a new trial rather than a final termination of the trial stage of the controversy would better serve the ends of justice. In short, the rule does not compel a trial judge to enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict instead of ordering a new trial; it permits him to exercise a discretion to choose between the two alternatives. See Berry v. United States, supra, \\n312 \\nU.S. 452\\n, \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 216]\\n \\n 453, 61 S.Ct. 638.4 And he can exercise this discretion with a fresh personal knowledge of the issues involved, the kind of evidence given, and the impression made by witnesses. His appraisal of the bona fides of the claims asserted by the litigants is of great value in reaching a conclusion as to whether a new trial should be granted. Determination of whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart. See March v. Philadelphia & West Chester Traction Co., 285 Pa. 413, 418, 132 A. 355; Bunn v. Furstein, 153 Pa.Super. 637, 638, 34 A.2d 924. See also Yutterman v. Sternberg, 8 Cir., 86 F.2d 321, 324, 111 A.L.R. 736. Exercise of this discretion presents to the trial judge an opportunity, after all his rulings have been made and all the evidence has been evaluated, to view the proceedings in a perspective peculiarly available to him alone. He is thus afforded 'a last chance to correct his own errors without delay, expense, or other hardships of an appeal.' See Greer v. Carpenter, 323 Mo. 878, 882, 19 S.W.2d 1046, 1047; Cf. United States v. Johnson, \\n327 \\nU.S. 106, 112\\n, 66 S.Ct. 464, 466. \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 217]\\n \\n There are other practical reasons why a litigant should not have his right to a new trial foreclosed without having had the benefit of the trial court's judgment on the question. Take the case where a trial court is about to direct a verdict because of failure of proof in a certain aspect of the case. At that time a litigant might know or have reason to believe that he could fill the crucial gap in the evidence. Traditionally, a plaintiff in such a dilemma has had an unqualifi d right, upon payments of costs, to take a nonsuit in order to file a new action after further preparation, unless the defendant would suffer some plain legal prejudice other than the mere prospect of a second lawsuit. Pleasants v. Fant, 22 Wall. 116, 122; Jones v. S.E.C., \\n298 \\nU.S. 1, 19\\n, 20 S., 56 S.Ct. 654, 659, and cases cited. Rule 41(a)(1) preserves this unqualified right of the plaintiff to a dismissal without prejudice prior to the filing of defendant's answer. And after the filing of an answer, Rule 41(a)(2) still permits a trial court to grant a dismissal without prejudice 'upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.' \\n 5\\n \\n\\n In this case had respondents made a timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the petitioner could have either presented reasons to show why he should have a new trial, or at least asked the court for permission to dismiss. If satisfied from the knowledge acquired from the trial and because of the reasons urged that the ends of justice would best be served by allowing petitioner another chance, the judge could have so provided in his discretion. The respondent failed to submit \\n\\n[330 \\nU.S. 212, 218]\\n \\n a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the trial judge in order that he might exercise his discretionary power to determine whether there should be such a judgment, a dismissal or a new trial. In the absence of such a motion, we think the appellate court was without power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.\\n It has been suggested that the petitioner could have presented affidavits to the Circuit Court of Appeals to support his claim for a new trial, and that that court could thereupon have remanded the question to the District Court to pass upon it. \\n6\\n Such a circuitous method of determining the question cannot be approved. For Rule 50(b) specifically prescribes a period of ten days for making a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Yet the method here suggested would enable litigants to extend indefinitely the prescribed ten day period simply by adoption of the expedient of an appeal. Furthermore, it would present the question initially to the appellate court when the primary discretionary responsibility for its decision rests on the District Court.\\n Reversed. \\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n[\\nFootnote 1\\n] Under governing South Carolina law an action such as this is not one to try title but 'to recover damages for trespass of property of which the plaintiff was in possession.' Macedonia Baptist Church v. City of Columbia, 195 S.C. 59, 70, 10 S.E.2d 350, 355. But possession may be presumed from proof of legal title. Beaufort Land and Investment Co. v. New River Lumber Co., 86 S.C. 358, 68 S.E. 637, 30 L.R.A.,N.S., 243; Haithcock v. Haithcock, 123 S.C. 61, 115 S.E. 727; Code of Laws of South Carolina (1942)  377. Petitioner here undertook to prove possession both by showing that he had legal title and by showing that he had openly and notoriously exercised acts of dominion, possession, and ownership over a long period of years. \\n[\\nFootnote 2\\n] Respondent first moved to dismiss the case on the same grounds under Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. That rule provides for a dismissal, under the circumstances and conditions there set out where 'upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.' Since substantially the same disposition of the case on the same grounds was later requested by respondent in the motion for a directed verdict, we shall have no occasion further to discuss the motion to dismiss. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 3\\n] 50(b) 'Reservation of Decision on Motion. Whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion. Within 10 days after the reception of a verdict, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict .... A motion for a new trial may be joined with this motion, or a new trial may be prayed for in the alternative. If a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed. If no verdict was returned the court may direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed or may order a new trial. \\n\\n[\\nFootnote 4\\n] The Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure in commenting on Rule 50(b) stated that 'A trial court or an appellate court in setting aside a verdict always has discretion, if justice requires it, to order a new trial, instead of directing the entry of judgment. Rule 50(b) states that the court on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 'may either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment' for the moving party.'

       "0  [United States Supreme Court UNITED STATES v. THAYER-WEST POINT HOTEL CO.(1947), No. 106 Argued: December 20, 1946Decided: January 20, 1947 Mr. Oscar H. Davis, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner., [329 U.S. 585, 586], Mr.E. J. Ellenwood, of New York City, for respondent., Mr. Justice MURPHY delivered the opinion of the Court., The decision here turns upon the power of the Court of Claims, in light of 177(a) of the Judicial Code,1 to include interest in its award of 'just compensation' to a lessee for the construction of a hotel and other buildings pursuant to the provisions of the Act of March 30, 1920.2, The act of March 30, 1920, authorizes the Secretary of War to lease land on the United States Military Reservation at West Point, N.Y., to any person for a term not exceeding 50 years upon which to erect a hotel and other necessary buildings in connection therewith., The lease is to contain such conditions, terms, reservations and covenants as may be agreed upon and is to provide 'for just compensation to the lessees for the construction of said hotel, appurtenances, and equipments, to be paid to said lessees at the termination of said lease.', On October 17, 1924, the Secretary of War duly made a lease under this Act to one Williams for a period of 50 years., The lease provided, among other things, that it might be cancelled at any time by the Secretary if the lessee should fail to observe all the covenants and conditions in the lease., One of the covenants was that the lessee was to 'keep the said hotel open for business every day during the continuance of this lease, except at such times as permission to close may be given in writing by the Superintendent, U.S.M.A.' Upon a cancellation of the lease, 'just compensation' was to be paid to the lessee for the construction of the hotel, appurtenances and equipment, and title thereto was to pass at once to the United States., [329 U.S. 585, 587] Similar provisions were made in connection with the termination of the lease on the expiration of the 50-year term., The lease also set forth numerous restrictions and requirements as to the operation of the hotel- such restrictions and requirements being primarily for the benefit of the Military Academy., The lease was assigned to a corporation and a hotel and other buildings were subsequently erected., Through a series of events which need not be detailed here, the respondent took over the leasehold and the hotel properties in 1930 with the approval of the Superintendent of the Military Academy., Respondent began operating the hotel on January 1, 1931, and continued under the terms of the lease until March 10, 1943 On January 5, 1943, respondent wrote to the Secretary of War that conditions then existing made continued operation of the hotel impossible and that to avoid a curtailment of operations or a closing down of the hotel 'the properties should be owned and operated by the Government.', It was accordingly suggested that the Secretary declare the lease forfeited upon the closing of the hotel by respondent, a default contemplated by the lease., The Secretary agreed to this proposal., The respondent then gave notice of its intention to close the hotel on the morning of March 10, 1943., The agents of the Secretary immediately took over the possession, management and operation of the hotel on March 10 and shortly thereafter the Secretary declared the lease annulled., The parties were unable to agree on the amount of 'just compensation' due under the lease., Respondent then brought this suit in the Court of Claims, praying for a judgment in the sum of $1,932.000., That court found that the 'total of just compensation to the plaintiff for construction of the hotel, its appurtenances, and equipments, is therefore $867,682, as of March 10, 1943.', 64 [329 U.S. 585, 588] F.Supp. 565, 568., The court then added interest at the rate of 4% per annum from March 10, 1943, to the date of payment as 'additional allowance to make compensation a just one as of the date of payment.', The sole question before us concerns the propriety of adding the 4% interest from March 10, 1943., The pertinent part of 177(a) of the Judicial Code provides that 'No interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the phyment of interest, ....' Section 177(a) thus embodies the traditional rule that interest cannot be recovered against the United States upon unpaid accounts or claims in the absence of an express provision to the contrary in a relevant statute or contract., Tillson v. United States, 100 U.S. 43 , 47; United States v. North American Transportation & Trading Co., 253 U.S. 30, 336 , 40 S.Ct. 518, 521; United States v. Goltra, 312 U.S. 203, 207 , 61 S. Ct. 487, 490., This rule is inapplicable, however, where the United States takes property under its power of eminent domain; in such cases it has consistently been held that the Fifth Amendment's reference to 'just compensation' entitles the property owner to receive interest from the date of the taking to the date of payment as a part of his just compensation., Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 299, 306 , 43 S.Ct. 354, 356; Brooks-Scanlon Corporation v. United States, 265 U.S. 106, 123 , 44 S.Ct. 471, 474; Phelps v. United States, 274 U.S. 341, 344 , 47 S.Ct. 611, 612., Since it is clear in the instant case that the United States did not exercise its power of eminent domain and that there was no taking of the hotel properties in the legal sense, we can put to one side the eminent domain situation., There is nothing more here than an ordinary contractual relationship between the United States and the respondent., That relationship was voluntarily entered into by respondent's predecessor and was severed at respondent's suggestion., The Government's liability to [329 U.S. 585, 589] pay for the construction of the hotel properties was fixed by the Act of March 30, 1920, and by the lease, not by the Constitution., The sole issue thus becomes whether there is any express provision in the Act or in the lease permitting the recovery of interest under the circumstances., Only if there is such a provision can respondent avoid the traditional rule set forth in 177(a)., Respondent's claim in this respect rests upon the references in the Act and in the lease to the payment of 'just compensation' for the construction of the hotel, appurtenances and equipment. 'Just compensation,' it is said, is to be given the same meaning here as in the case of a taking under the power of eminent domain, thereby entitling respondent to the full value of the properties down to the date of payment., From this viewpoint, the Court of Claims could use interest at the rate of 4% as the measure of the value of the use of the hotel properties from the time when the Government took possession on March 10, 1943, to the time of payment and include such interest as a component part of just compensation., The conclusion is reached that the term 'just compensation,' as used in the Act and in the lease, constitutes an express provision for interest so that the bar of 177(a) is removed., We cannot agree., The fact that 'just compensation' includes interest in the eminent domain setting does not necessarily mean that the term must be given the same scope in other situations., United States v. Goltra, supra., It may or it may not imply an obligation to pay interest., For example, interest conceivably may not be contemplated where the term refers to compensatory damages for a tort or a breach of contract, or where it has reference to the price to be paid for the exchange or sale of property at a future date., Hence, in the absence of constitutional connotations, 'just compensation' is not a term of art so far as interest is [329 U.S. 585, 590] concerned., The inclusion or exclusion of interest depends upon other contractual provisions, the intention of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the use of the term., But in order to override the historical rule codified in 177(a), something more is necessary than an equivocal use of the term 'just compensation.', It is not enough that the term might be construed to include the payment of interest., As 177(a) itself indicates, there must be a provision in the contract 'expressly stipulating for the payment of interest.', That provision must be affirmative, clear-cut, unambiguous; and an unexpressed intention by the parties that the term 'just compensation' be construed to include interest is insufficient., Likewise, where a statute is relied upon to overcome the force of 177(a), the intention of Congress to permit the rec very of interest must be expressly and specifically set forth in the statute., Tillson v. United States, supra, 100 U.S. at page 46;, United States ex rel. Angarica de la Rua v. Bayard, 127 U.S. 251, 260 , 8 S.Ct. 1156, 1160, 1161., Mere use of the term 'just compensation,' without more, is no substitute for an express provision for interest., Here neither the Act of March 30, 1920, nor the lease under which respondent operated contains an express provision for the payment of interest, either in addition to or as a part of the 'just compensation' to be paid to respondent., If the United States had desired to provide by statute or to contract in the lease for the payment of interest, it would have been easy to have said so in express terms., 3 Because it did not say so, we are led irresistibly to the conclusion that it did not intend to negative the effect of 177(a) in this instance., Tillson v. United States, supra., [329 U.S. 585, 591], We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Claims to the extent that it includes an allowance for interest., Reversed.

       "1  [United States Supreme Court BOZZA v. UNITED STATES(1947), No. 190 Argued: Decided: February 17, 1947 [330 U.S. 160, 162], Mr. W. Marvin Smith, of Washington, D.C., for respondent., Mr. Harold Simandl, of Newark, N.J., for petitioner., Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court., The petitioner and one Chirichillo were convicted in a Federal District Court on all counts of a five-count indictment against them which charged violation of the Internal Revenue laws in connection with the operation of a still., The Court of Appeals reversed petitioner's conviction on counts four and five because of insufficient evidence, but affirmed as to counts one, two, and three., 3 Cir., 155 F.2d 592., We granted certiorari., 329 U.S. 698 , 67 S.Ct. 58., Count one charged that the defendants had carried on 'the business of a distiller ... with intent willfully to defraud the ..., United States of the tax on ... spirits so distilled ...' in violation of 26 U.S.C. 2833(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code, 2833(a)., Count two charged them with having had possession and custody of the still in violation of 26 U.S.C. 2810(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code, 2810(a)., Count three charged that they had made and fermented mash for the production of alcohol in violation of 26 U.S.C. 2834, 26 U. S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, 2834., It is argued that the evidence was insufficient to support any of the three counts here at issue., The Government concedes its insufficiency as to counts two and three., There was testimony to show the following:, Chirichillo rented a farmhouse under an assumed name and installed a 300-gallon still with all equipment necessary to ferment mash and distill alcohol., The still was operated day and night., Chirichillo himself mixed the ingredients to make the mash in the attic of the 2 1/2-story frame building, but the alcohol distillation was carried on in another part of the building., Petitioner was at the house two or three times a week., When there he took instructions from [330 U.S. 160, 163] Chirichillo and helped him in the operation of the still; he helped manufacture the alcohol., When Chirichillo carried his products to Newark, the car in which he carried the illicitly distilled alcohol would follow along behind another car-sometimes petitioner's, sometimes another helper's., The farmhouse where the illicit business was carried on appeared from the outside to be deserted; the windows were without shades and the house had been practically stripped of furniture., We accept the Government's concession that the evidence fails to show that this petitioner had made, or helped to make, the mash as charged in count three., All of the evidence showed that Chirichillo alone handled and mixed the ingredients of the mash, and there is nothing whatever to indicate that the petitioner ever took any part in, or aided and abetted, this particular part of the unlawful process in any manner, or, indeed, that he was ever in or around the attic where the mash was made from ingredients stored there., The Internal Revenue statutes have broken down the various steps and phases of a continuous illicit distilling business and made each of them a separate offense., Thus, these statutes have clearly carved out the conduct of making mash as a separate offense, thereby distinguishing it from the other offenses involving other steps and phases of the distilling business., Consequently, testimony to prove this separate offense of making mash must point directly to conduct within the narrow margins which the statute alone d fines., One who neither engages in the conduct specifically prohibited, nor aids and abets it, does not violate the section which prohibits it., The sufficiency of the evidence as to count two which charged that the petitioner had custody or possession of the still is a closer question., It might be possible that petitioner's helping to make the alcohol aided and abetted in its 'custody or possession.', But that would be a very strained inference under any circumstances., Here again [330 U.S. 160, 164] the statutes treat custody or possession as a wholly distinct offense., Yet there was no testimony that the petitioner ever exercised, or aided the exercise of, any control over the distillery., His participation in carrying the finished product by car does not fit the category of 'custody and possession' so nearly as it resembles the transportation of illegal liquor, 26 U.S.C. 2803, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, 2803-an offense which the Circuit Court of Appeals has found the evidence insufficient to prove., Nor was there any testimony that the petitioner acted in any other capacity calculated to facilitate the custody or possession, such as, for illustration, service as a caretaker, watchman, lookout, or in some other similar capacity., Under these circumstances, we accept the Government's concession that a judgment of guilty should not have been rendered on the second count., We think there was adequate evidence to support a finding of guilt on the first count which charged operation of the business of distilling to defraud the Government of taxes., There was certainly ample evidence to show that Chirichillo carried on the business of a distiller and that the petitioner helped him to do it., 18 U.S.C. 550, 18 U.S.C.A. 550, provides that one who aids and abets another to commit a crime is guilty as a principal., Consequently, the jury had a right to find, as it did, that the petitioner and Chirichillo were equally guilty of operating the business of the distillery., See United States v. Johnson, 319 U.S. 503, 515 , 518 S., 63 S.Ct. 1233, 1239, 1240 But, it is argued, there was no evidence that the petitioner acted with knowledge that the distillery business was carried on with an intent to defraud the Government of its taxes., The same evidence as to knowledge of this guilty purpose, however, that applied to Chirichillo was almost, if not quite, equally persuasive against both defendants., Petitioner assisted in the manufacture of alcohol in Chirichillo's still which was operated under con- [330 U.S. 160, 165] ditions of secretiveness in an apparently abandoned farmhouse., The finished alcohol was carried to Newark in a car which followed another car, sometimes the petitioner's., The members of the jury could properly draw on their own experience and observations that lawful stills, unlike the still in which petitioner worked, usually are not operated clandestinely and do not deliver their products in the fashion employed here., The members of the jury were not precluded from drawing inferences as to fraudulent purposes from these circumstances, nor were they compelled to believe that this petitioner was oblivious of the purposes of what went on around him., Men in the jury box, like men on the street, can conclude that a person who actively helps to operate a secret distillery knows that he is helping to violate Government revenue laws., That is a well known object of an illicit distillery., Doubtless few who ever worked in such a place, or even heard about one, would fail to understand the cry: 'The Revenuers are coming!', We hold that the verdict of guilty on the first count must stand., The only statute for violation of which petitioner's conviction is sustained by us carries a minimum mandatory sentence of fine of one hundred dollars and imprisonment, 26 U.S.C. 2833(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code, 2833(a)., In announcing sentence at a morning session, the trial judge mentioned imprisonment only., Thereafter the petitioner was taken briefly to the U.S. Marshal's office and then to a local federal detention jail awaiting transportation to the penitentiary where he was finally to be confined., But about five hours after the sentence was announced, the judge recalled the petitioner and according to stipulation, stated in the presence of petitioner and his counsel that 'in the imposition of sentence this morning ..., it has been called to my attention that there are certain mandatory fines and penalties which I omitted to impose., For the record now minimum mandatory fines and penalties will be imposed.', Thus a one [330 U.S. 160, 166] hundred dollar fine was fixed as required by law, along with the imprisonment sentence., Petitioner charges that this action constituted double jeopardy forbidden by the Federal Constitution., It is well established that a sentence which does not comply with the letter of the criminal statute which authorizes it is so erroneous that it may be set aside on appeal, Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 168 , 169 S., 8 Otto 145, 168, 169; Murphy v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 177 U.S. 155, 157 , 20 S.Ct. 639, 640, or in habeas corpus proceedings., In re Bonner, 151 U.S. 242 , 14 S.Ct. 323., But in those cases it was recognized that an excessive sentence should be corrected, even though the prisoner had already served part of his term, not by absolute discharge of the prisoner, but by an appropriate amendment of the invalid sentence by the court of original jurisdiction, at least during the term of court in which the invalid sentence was imposed., 1 Cf. De Benque v. United States, 66 App.D.C. 36, 85 F.2d 202, 106 A.L.R. 839., In the light of these cases, the fact that petitioner has been twice before the judge for sentencing and in a federal place of detention during the five hour interim cannot be said to constitute double jeopardy as we have heretofore considered it., Petitioner contends, however, that these cases are inapplicable here because correction of this sentence so as to make it lawful increases his punishment., Cf. United States v. Benz, 282 U.S. 304, 309 , 51 S.Ct. 113, 114., If this inadvertent error cannot be corrected in the manner used here by the trial court, no valid and enforceable sentence can be imposed at all., Cf. Jordan v. United States, 4 Cir., 60 F.2d 4, 6 with Barrow v. United States, 54 App.D.C. 128, 295 F. 949., This Court has rejected the 'doctrine that a prisoner, whose guilt is established by a regular verdict, is to escape punishment altogether because the court committed an error in passing the sentence.', In re Bonner, supra, 151 U.S. at page 260, 14 S.Ct. at page 327., The Constitution does not require that sentencing should be a game [330 U.S. 160, 167] in which a wrong move by the judge means immunity for the prisoner., See King v. United States, 69 App.D.C. 10, 98 F.2d 291, 296., In this case the court 'only set aside what it had no authority to do, and substitute(d) directions required by the law to be done upon the conviction of the offender.', In re Bonner, supra, 151 U.S. at page 260, 14 S.Ct. at page 327., It did not twice put petitioner in jeopardy for the same offense., 2 The sentence as corrected, imposes a valid punishment for an offense instead of an invalid punishment for that offense., Other contentions here do not merit our discussion., The judgment as to count one is affirmed., The judgment is reversed as to counts two and three., It is so ordered., Affirmed in part and reversed in part., Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, Mr. Justice MURPHY, and Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE dissenting as to the affirmance of the judgment on count one., We are of the view that to convict one as an aider and abetter in engaging in or carrying on a distillery business with intent 'to defraud' the United States of the tax on the distilled spirits, 53 Stat. 319, 26 U. S.C. 2833(a), 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, 2833(a), evidence is necessary which shows that by some act of concealment he promoted the fraud, or by counsel and advice furthered the unlawful scheme, or in fact had [330 U.S. 160, 168] some interest in the project., 1 See United States v. Cooper, 25 Fed.Cas. pages 627, 629, No. 14,863; United States v. Logan, 26 Fed.Cas. pages 900, 992, No. 15,624; Seiden v. United States, 2 Cir., 16 F.2d 197, 199; Partson v. United States, 8 Cir., 20 F.2d 127, 129; Anderson v. United States, 5 Cir., 30 F.2d 485, 487., Aiding and abetting in the illicit manufacture of liquor is one thing., 2 Aiding and abetting in carrying on the business with intent to defraud the United States of a tax is quite a different matter, and requires a different test, if the two offenses are not to be blended., The evidence in the case and the instructions given the jury3 seem to us inadequate to sustain a con- [330 U.S. 160, 169] viction under count one, charging Bozza with aiding and abetting in a tax fraud scheme., In view of this conclusion, Mr. Justice RUTLEDGE reserves expression of opinion concerning the legality of the sentence., Footnotes [ Footnote 1 ], Compare Rule 45(c), Rules of Criminal Procedure for the District Courts of the United States, 18 U.S.C.A. following section 687., [ Footnote 2 ], In Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, relied on by petitioner here, the defendant had been sentenced to fine and imprisonment for violation of a statute which authorized a sentence only of fine or imprisonment., Since he had paid his fine and therefore suffered punishment under a valid sentence, it was held that his sentence had been 'executed by full satisfaction of one of the alternative penalties of the law ....', Murphy v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, supra, 177 U.S. at page 160, 20 S. Ct. at page 641., Therefore, Lange's plea, that the trial court could not correct the sentenc without causing him to suffer double punishment, was sustained., Cf. In re Bradley, 318 U.S. 50 , 63 S.Ct. 470., But here the petitioner had not suffered any lawful punishment until the court had announced the full mandatory sentence of imprisonment and fine., [ Footnote 1 ] Judge Learned Hand, after reviewing the various definitions of aiding and abetting, said: 'It will be observed that all these definitions have nothing whatever to do with the probability that the forbidden result would follow upon the accessory's conduct; and that they all demand that he in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something that he wishes to bring about, that he seek by his action to make it succeed., All the words used-even the most colorless, 'abet'-carry an implication of purposive attitude towards it.', ...]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "2  [United States Supreme Court CONFEDERATED BANDS OF UTE INDIANS v. UNITED STATES(1947), No. 141 Argued: Decided: February 17, 1947 As Amended March 31, 1947.[ Confederated Bands of Ute Indians v. United States 330 U.S. 169 (1947) ] [330 U.S. 169, 171] Mr. Ernest L. Wilkinson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners., Mr. Marvin J. Sonosky, of Washington D.C., for respondent., Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court., Petitioners brought this action in the Court of Claims under the Act of June 28, 1938, 52 Stat. 1209, as amended, 55 Stat. 593, to recover compensation for lands made available to them by an 1875 Executive Order of the President and sub-sequently taken from them by the United States., Their claim was that by an Act of June 15, 1880, 21 Stat. 199, Congress had undertaken to sell these lands for the benefit of the petitioners, but that they had never been compensated for them., The Court of Claims, one judge concurring specially, made findings of fact and concluded as a matter of law that petitioners had no compensable interest in the lands because they 'never did acquire title to these ... lands and ..., the Congress never did agree to sell them for the account of' petitioners., Ct. Cl., 64 F.Supp. 569, 571., We granted certiorari, 329 U.S. 694 , 67 S.Ct. 50., The findings of the Court of Claims from official letters, Executive Orders and statutes incorporated in these findings were as follows: [330 U.S. 169, 172] A treaty of March 2, 1868, 15 Stat. 619, between the United States and petitioners' ancestors, the Ute Indian tribes, established a reservation for them in Colorado., The northern boundary of the 15 million acres there ceded was described in the treaty as a line fifteen miles north of, and parallel to the 40th parallel of north latitude., In the 15- mile wide strip north of the 40th parallel lay the White River Valley which had been settled by the Utes as a most suitable place for grazing and cultivation., One of the two Government Indian agencies provided for the reservation by the treaty was established in that strip., As a result of misunderstandings in 1869 and 1874 between the Utes and white settlers to the north as to the true location of the northern treaty boundary, a survey was made in 1875 by one Miller., Miller's instructions, however, required him to stake out a line which he admitted to the local Indian agent and to the Utes themselves to be fifteen to eighteen miles south of the true boundary described in the treaty., If Miller's line had been correct, it would have excluded from the 1868 reservation the fertile White River Valley, and would have also excluded the agency buildings which had been erected there., The marking out of the erroneous Miller line greatly upset the Indians because they feared they would be driven from the White River Valley., This embarrassed the local Indian agent who had previously assured the Indians that the White River Valley lay within their reservation., He promptly reported the results of the survey and the reaction of the Indians to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, and urged the necessity of a new survey at the earliest practicable date., He stated that if the Miller survey were correct, however, the Indians would be driven from the White River Valley-'the only farming land and stock range in this part of the reservation'-and forced to settle on [330 U.S. 169, 173] a river forty miles to the south., The Commissioner, acting on this report and a statement by Miller's attorney that Miller's line was correct, wrote to the Secretary of the Interior that the Miller survey 'develops the fact that the White River and surrounding valleys as well as the Agency buildings and improvements at the White River Agency lie north of the ... boundary and consequently are not within the limits of the ..., Ute Reservation.', He therefore recommended to the Secretary that the President be requested to issue an Executive Order to make available to the Utes additional territory north of the 1868 treaty boundary., The President, on t e recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, issued the order., 1 And thereafter the Commissioner wrote the local agent that the order included 'all that tract of country lying between the north boundary of the Ute reservation as defined in the treaty of March 2, 1868 ..., which was the boundary surveyed by Mr. Miller. ..., This action fully protects your Indians in the peaceable possession of their improvements in the White River Valley and the Agency buildings, and will enable you to assure the Indians of the exact location of their reservation as enlarged.' [330 U.S. 169, 174], In 1879, several years after the Executive Order was issued, hostilities broke out between some of the Utes and Government representatives in which the Indian agent at White River, all the agency's male employees, and a U.S. military detachment were killed in the so- called 'Meeker massacre.' Ex. Doc. No. 1, pt. 5, 47th Cong., 2d Sess. ( 1879) 16-19, 82-97., There have been charges and counter-charges as to who was responsible for inciting these hostilities., Whoever was responsible, it is clear that Congress, aroused by the massacre, took steps to punish the Indians who participated in it, to dispossess the Utes of their reservation, and to remove them from Colorado., Congressional action to accomplish this was provided by the Act of June 15, 1880, 21 Stat. 199, which ratified and embodied an agreement reached earlier that year between the Government and the leaders of the Utes who had promised 'to use their best endeavors with their people to procure their consent to cede to the United States all the territory of the present Ute Reservation ....', This Act authorized specific allotments to individual Indians from the lands so ceded., But 3 provided that 'all the lands not ... allotted, the title to which is, by the said agreement of ..., the Ute Indians, and this acceptance by the United States, released and conveyed to the United States ...' would be restored to the public domain for sale as public lands., The proceeds of the sale of the land so conveyed by the Utes to the United States were, upon satisfaction of indemnity conditions imposed because of the massacre, to be distributed to the Indians., Thereafter, in 1882, an Executive Order declared that the lands withdrawn from the public domain by the Executive Order of 1875 and 'set apart for the use of the ..., Ute Indians ... hereby is, restored to the public domain.', 1 Kappler, supra, pp. 834, 834., Pursuant to an Act of 1909, 35 Stat. 781, petitioners recovered a judgment for the proceeds of certain lands sold [330 U.S. 169, 175] by the Government, as well as the value of certain lands appropriated by the Government to its own use, all of which were part of the 1868 treaty lands., The Ute Indians v. United States, 45 Ct.Cl. 440; 46 Ct.Cl. 225., Thus, except for certain treaty lands not at issue here, litigation concerning which is now pending in the Court of Claims, the only lands in Colorado for which the Indians have not been paid are those to the north of and outside the 1868 treaty reservation which were made avail ble to them by the Executive Order of 1875., In pursuit of compensation for these Executive Order lands, petitioners have brought this action pursuant to the Act of June 28, 1938, supra., That Act confers jurisdiction on the Court of Claims to hear, determine, and render final judgment on all legal and equitable claims of the Utes and to award judgment for the Indians where it is found 'that any lands formerly belonging' to them 'have been taken by the United States without compensation ....', Petitioners contend here that their predecessors understood that they not only owned the White River Valley lands, but that they also owned the Executive Order lands when, in 1880, they agreed to cede their reservation; and that Congress, by incorporating the agreement in the 1880 Act, thereby ratified it along with the Indians' understanding of it., Petitioners further contend that whether or not Congress intended to obligate the Government to account for the Executive Order lands, they knew of the Indians' understanding so that 'the understanding of the Indians having been established,' their understanding entitles them to recover., Finally they argue that the Executive Order unlike the one in issue in Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, 316 U.S. 317 , 62 S.Ct. 1095, conveyed a compensable interest to these Indians., The Government counters that the President had no power to give a compensable interest to the Indians to lands lying outside the true 1868 treaty boundaries; that if the President intended [330 U.S. 169, 176] to make available lands outside the true boundary it was only to give a transitory, possessory, and not a compensable, interest; that his intent was, in fact, only to secure the Indians in their possession of the White River Valley, but no more, on the mistaken assumption that the White River Valley had been cut off from the reservation by the Miller survey; that the 1880 Act, neither by its terms, its legislative history, nor its administrative interpretation, suggests that Congress intended to ratify or expand the Executive Order or to compensate the Indians for the Executive Order lands; that the Indians did not have a contrary understanding; that in the face of such clear legislative language and intent, a contrary understanding of the Indians, even if established, could not justify a holding that the Indians obtained a compensable interest., It is conceded that the petitioners have either been, or are currently pressing litigation in the Court of Claims by which they seek to be, compensated for the White River Valley lands, and in fact, for all of the land which was contained in the true boundaries of the 1868 reservation., The additional claim, insofar as it rests on the Executive Order of 1875, cannot be sustained., For the President had no authority to convey to the petitioners a compensable interest in the lands described in the order lying north of the true 1868 boundary., Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, supra., 2 Nor is there any indication in the findings that the President intended to convey more than a transitory, possessory interest by the 1875 Order., That order made the Indians no more than tenants at the will of the Government on that part of the land outside the true treaty reservation., Id. 316 U.S. at page 331, 62 S.Ct. at page 1101., Moreover, the Court of Claims' findings of fact, as emphasized [330 U.S. 169, 177] by the special concurring opinion, indicate that the Executive Order was promulgated under the mistaken belief that its issuance was necessary in order to give the Indians the use of the White River Valley lands intended to be granted to them by the 1868 treaty and from which they might otherwise have been excluded by the Miller survey., These findings do not indicate that the Commissioner, the Secretary, or the President intended the order to make available the lands it in fact described lying north of the true treaty boundary., The order was designed only to resolve the misunderstanding created by Miller about the White River Valley lands., 3 The fullest possible purpose of the Executive Order has actually been carried out., For the Indians' enjoyment of the White River lands was protected during their stay on the reservation, and the lands have either already been paid for, or are the subject of pending litigation in the Court of Claims whereby the Indians seek payment for them., It is with these things in mind that we must consider petitioner's contention that they have a right to recover compensation because of the 1880 Act., There is not one word in that Act showing a congressional purpose to convey the Executive Order lands, or any other lands, to the Indians., On the contrary, the Act embodied a transaction whereby the Indians were the transferors and conveyed lands to the Government., For the value of lands so conveyed, and for no other, the Government was to make an account to the Indians after certain deductions had been made. [330 U.S. 169, 178], Nor is it possible to deduce from the 1880 Act a congressional purpose to transform the Executive Order into a conveyance of something more than a mere temporary and cancellable possessory right to the Indians., Neither the language of the 1880 Act, its legislative history, nor the circumstances which brought it about, justify the claim that Congress intended to expand the Executive Order into a transfer of a compensable interest in lands not included in the original treaty reservation., The Act was an aftermath of the 'Meeker massacre.', With the massacre in mind, Congress decided to remove the Indians from the Colorado reservation as part of the punishment meted out for this tragedy., 4 The very first section of the 1880 Act prohibited any payments at all to the Indians until the Indians involved had surrendered, been apprehended, or until the President had proof that they were dead or outside the United States., Compensation for the families of the massacre victims was to be deducted from the land sale proceeds payable to the Indians., We cannot find from this background a congressional purpose to make a gift to the Indians of the Executive Order lands for which compensation is here sought., The only lands for which Congress agreed in 1880 to compensate the Indians were those that 'the title to which' the Indians then 'released and conveyed to the United States.', They could only release and convey the lands that belonged to them, and only the lands given to them by the original 1868 treaty belonged to them., It was for compensation for such lands only that Congress, in 1938, authorized this action to be maintained., Under all these circumstances, the fact that the 1880 Act required the chiefs and headmen to procure the consent of their people to the cession of 'the present Ute Reservation,' is not sufficient to attribute to Congress [330 U.S. 169, 179] a purpose to treat as a part of that reservation, lands which had never been legally conveyed to the Indians and which had only been made available to them by the Executive Order for the sole purpose of making them secure in their possession of the White River Valley., It is said, however, that the Indians understood in 1880 that they owned the Executive Order lands which lay north of the White River Valley; that they understood their 'present Ute reservation' to include them; that they understood that Congress undertook by the 1880 Act to sell the lands for their benefit; and that Congress was aware of this understanding., The majority opinion of the Court of Claims stated that 'in all probability' this was true., The writer of the concurring opinion thought differently., But even if the Indians had believed that they had a compensable interest in the Executive Order lands, this fact would not necessarily have given it to them., Certainly the absence of presidential authority to give them a compensable title could not be supplied by the Indians' understanding that the President had such authority., The Sioux Indians may also have thought the President had authority to convey title to them; but the reasons on which our decision in the Sioux case, supra, rested do not indicate that our holding depended in any way upon the understanding of the Indians., Nor can this alleged understanding be imputed to Congress in the face of plain language and a rather full legislative history indicating that the 1880 Act neither conveyed nor ratified conveyance of these lands., While it has long been the rule that a treaty with Indians is to be construed so as to carry out the Government's obligations in accordance with the fair understanding of the Indians, we cannot, under the guise of interpretation, create Presidential authority where there was none, nor rewrite congressional acts so as to make them mean something they obviously were not intended to mean., Choctaw Nation of Indians v. United [330 U.S. 169, 180] States, 318 U.S. 423, 431 , 432 S., 63 S.Ct. 672, 677, 678., We cannot, under any acceptable rule of interpretation, hold that the Indians owned the lands merely because they thought so., Solicitous as the Government is to carry out its promises to the Indians in good faith, we are satisfied from this record that the Government has performed all that it promised., As we have pointed out, it seems obvious to us from the findings of the Court of Claims that the Executive Order was only intended to secure for these Indians' ancestors possession of the White River Valley lands conveyed to them by the original 1868 treaty, and which was jeopardized by the Miller survey., 5 In fact, the President had no authority to convey a compensable interest in these or other lands to the Utes. Fairly to carry out the 1868 treaty was the order's aim., The 1880 Act, we believe, did not enlarge upon the limited purpose of the Executive Order., To compensate these Indians for lands, not intended to be conveyed by the 1868 treaty, the Executive Order, nor the 1880 Act, would be to pay them for lands which neither they nor their ancestors ever owned and to which they had no claim in equity or justice, so far as the transactions here at issue are concerned., No rule of construction justifies such a result., AFFIRMED., Mr. Justice MURPHY, dissenting., The United States, in my opinion, is morally and legally obligated to pay for the land in issue in this case., The Executive Order of 1875 by its terms set aside certain land up to the 'first standard parallel north' for the use of the Ute Indians 'as an addition to their present reservation.', That order alone, of course, could convey no compensable interest to the Indians under the rule of Sioux Tribe of Indians v. United States, 316 U.S. 317 , 62 S.Ct. 1095., But events subsequent to [330 U.S. 169, 181] the issuance of the Executive Order in this case make inapplicable the principle of the Sioux case., In 1880 the United States and the Ute chiefs and headmen entered into an agreement whereby the latter promised 'to use their best endeavors with their people to procure their consent to cede to the United States all the territory of the present Ute Rese vation in Colorado.', Congress thereupon passed the Act of June 15, 1880, which recited in its preamble that the chiefs and headmen had 'submitted to the Secretary of the Interior an agreement for the sale to the United States of their present reservation in the State of Colorado.', The Act then incorporated the agreement previously made and provided that all unallotted lands should be deemed to be released and conveyed to the United States., ...]   \n",
       "3  [United States Supreme Court ANGEL v. BULLINGTON(1947), No. 31 Argued: Decided: February 17, 1947 [330 U.S. 183, 184] Mr. George Lyle Jones, of Asheville, N.C., for petitioner., Mr. R. Roy Rush, of Roanoke, Va., for respondent., R. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court., In 1940, Bullington, a citizen of Virginia, sold land in Virginia to Angel, a citizen of North Carolina., Only part of the purchase price was paid., For the balance, Angel executed a series of notes secured by a deed of trust on the land., Upon default on one of the notes, Bullington acting upon an acceleration clause in the deed, caused all other notes to become due and called upon the trus- [330 U.S. 183, 185] tees to sell the land., The sale was duly made in Virginia and the proceeds of the sale applied to the payment of the notes., This controversy concerns attempts to collect the deficiency., Bullington began suit for the deficiency in the Superior Court of Macon County, North Carolina., Angel countered with a demurrer, the substance of which was that a statute of North Carolina (c. 36, Public Laws 1933, Mitchie's Code 2593(f)) precluded recovery of such a deficiency judgment., This is the relevant portion of that enactment: 'In all sales of real property by mortgagees and/or trustees under powers of sale contained in any mortgage or deed of trust hereafter executed, ..., the mortgagee or trustee or holder of the notes secured by such mortgage or deed of trust shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account of such mortgage, deed of trust or obligation secured by the same: ...'., The Superior Court overruled the demurrer, and an appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina followd., Bullington supported his Superior Court judgment on the ground that the United States Constitution precluded North Carolina from shutting the doors of its courts to him., The North Carolina Supreme Court, holding that the North Carolina Act of 1933 barred Bullington's suit against Angel, reversed the Superior Court and dismissed the action., 220 N.C. 18, 16 S.E.2d 411, 136 A.L.R. 1054., Bullington did not seek to review this judgment here., Instead, he sued Angel for the deficiency in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina., Angel pleaded in bar the judgment in the North Carolina action., The District Court, 56 F.Supp. 372, gave judgment for Bullington and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed., 150 F.2d 679., We granted certiorari, 326 U.S. 713 , 66 S.Ct. 231, because the failure [330 U.S. 183, 186] to dismiss this action, on the ground that the judgment in the North Carolina court precluded the right thereafter to recover on the same cause of action in the federal court, presented an important question in the administration of justice., 1., We start with the fact that the prevailing rule as to res judicata is settled law in North Carolina., An adjudication bars future litigation between the same parties not only as to all issues actually raised and decided but also as to those which could have been raised., Southern Distributing Co. v. Carraway, 196 N.C. 58, 60, 61, 144 S.E. 535; Moore v. Harkins, 179 N.C. 167, 101 S.E. 564., When the disposition of a prior litigation is invoked as a bar to an action, the identity of the causes of action in the two suits is usually the bone of contention., On this score there can here be no controversy., It is indisputable that the parties, the nature of the claim and the desired relief were precisely the same in the two actions successively brought by Bullington against Angel, first in the Superior Court of Macon County and then in the federal district court., For all practical purposes, the complaint in the present action was a carbon copy of the complaint in the State court action., If the North Carolina action had been dismissed because it was brought in one North Carolina court rather than in another, of course no federal issue would have been involved., See, e.g., Woods v. Nierstheimer, 328 U.S. 211 , 66 S.Ct. 996., Had that been the case, a suit for the same cause of action could have been initiated in a North Carolina federal district court, just as another suit could have been brought in the proper North Carolina State court., But that is not the present situation., A quite different situation is before us., Being somewhat unusual, it calls for a critical consideration of the scope and purpose of the doctrine of res judicata., 2., The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina would clearly bar this suit had it been brought anew [330 U.S. 183, 187] in a state court., For purp ses of diversity jurisdiction a federal court is 'in effect, only another court of the State'., Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 108 , 65 S.Ct. 1464, 1469, 160 A.L.R. 1231; see Madisonville Traction Company v. Saint Bernard Mining Company, 196 U.S. 239, 253 , 25 S.Ct. 251, 256; Ex parte Schollenberger, 96 U.S. 369 , 377., Of course, Bullington could not have succeeded in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina after an adverse judgment in the State courts, had the decision in this case involved no federal ground., That is equally true where a federal question was decided in the State courts., That the adjudication of federal questions by the North Carolina Supreme Court may have been erroneous is immaterial for purposes of res judicata., Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, 274 U.S. 316, 325 , 47 S.Ct. 600, 604., A higher court was available for an authoritative adjudication of the federal questions involved., And so the question is whether federal rights were necessarily involved and adjudicated in the litigation in the State courts. 3., For purposes of res judicata, the significance of what a court says it decides is controlled by the issues that were open for decision., What were the issues in the North Carolina litigation?, Bullington sought a deficiency judgment., Angel, by demurrer, resisted on the ground that a North Carolina statute precluded a deficiency judgment., The North Carolina Supreme Court, reversing the trial court, found the North Carolina statute a bar to such a suit., It said that 'the limitation created by the statute is upon the jurisdiction of the court in that it is declared that the holder of notes given to secure the purchase price of real property 'shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account' thereof., This closes the courts of this state to one who seeks a deficiency judgment on a note given for the purchase price of real property., The statute operates upon the adjective law of the state, which pertains to the practice and procedure, [330 U.S. 183, 188] or legal machinery by which the substantive law is made effective, and not upon the substantive law itself., It is a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.' 220 N.C. 18, 20, 16 S.E.2d 411, 412, 136 A.L.R. 1054 But the allowable 'limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts' of North Carolina presents more than a question of local law for determination by the North Carolina Supreme Court., Speaking for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice Brandeis thus expressed the subordination to the requirements of the Constitution of the power of a State to withdraw jurisdiction from its courts: 'The power of a state to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them is, of course, subject to the restrictions imposed by the Federal Constitution.' McKnett v. St. Louis & S.F.R. Co., 292 U.S. 230, 233 , 54 S.Ct. 690, 691., The Contract Clause, U.S.Const. Art. 1, 10, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, U.S.Const. art., 4, 1, the Privileges or Immunities Clause, U.S.Const. art. 4, 2, all fetter the freedom of a State to deny access to its courts howsoever much it may regard such withdrawal of jurisdiction 'the adjective law of the State', or the exercise of its right to regulate 'the practice and procedure' of its courts., Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629, 642 , 55 S.Ct. 589, 592, 100 A.L.R. 1133., A State 'cannot escape its constitutional obligations by the simple device of denying jurisdiction in such cases to Courts otherwise competent.', Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U.S. 411, 415 , 40 S.Ct. 371, 372, 10 A.L. R. 716; and see White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646., This pervasive principle of our federal law, constitutional and statutory, was thus put by Mr. Justice Holmes: 'Whatever springes the State may set for those who are endeavoring to assert rights that the State confers, the assertion of Federal rights, w en plainly and reasonably made, is not to be defeated under the name of local practice.', Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U.S. 22, 24 , 44 S.Ct. 13, 14., 4., Here, claims based on the United States Constitution were plainly and reasonably made in the North Caro- [330 U.S. 183, 189] lina suit., The North Carolina Supreme Court met these claims., It met them by saying that the North Carolina statute did not deal with substantive matters but merely with matters regulating local procedure., But whether the claims are based on a federal right or are merely of local concern is itself a federal question on which this Court, and not the Supreme Court of North Carolina, has the last say., That Court could not put a federal claim aside, as though it were not in litigation, by the talismanic word 'jurisdiction'., When an asserted federal right is denied, the sufficiency of the grounds of denial is for this Court to decide., Titus v. Wallick, 306 U.S. 282, 291 , 59 S.Ct. 557, 562., Bullington could have come here, not merely by the grace of this Court on certiorari, but on appeal, as did White in White v. Hart, supra, to challenge, successfully, the right of Georgia to limit the jurisdiction of the Georgia courts; as did the East New York Savings Bank in the recent case of East New York Sav. Bank v. Hahn, 326 U.S. 230 , 66 S.Ct. 69, 160 A.L.R. 1279, to challenge, though unsuccessfully, the limitation which New York placed upon the jurisdiction of its courts., Cf. Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U.S. 411, 416 , 40 S.Ct. 371, 372, 10 A.L.R. 716., Since it was open for Bullington to come here to seek reversal of the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court shutting him out of the North Carolina courts and he chose not to do so, the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court concluded an adjudication of a federal question even though it was not couched in those terms., For purposes of litigating the issues in controversy in the North Carolina action, the North Carolina Supreme Court was an intermediate tribunal., If a litigant chooses not to continue to assert his rights after an intermediate tribunal has decided against him, he has concluded his litigation as effectively as though he had proceeded through the highest tribunal available to him., An adjudication of an issue implies that a man had a chance to win his case., The chance was necessarily afforded by the North Carolina litigation. [330 U.S. 183, 190], It was in process of determination when the Supreme Court of North Carolina decided against him., He forewent his right to have a higher court, this Court, enable him to win his chance by holding that he was right and that the North Carolina Supreme Court was wrong., He cannot begin all over again in an action involving the same issues before another forum in the same State. 5., It is suggested that the North Carolina Supreme Court did not adjudicate the 'merits' of the controversy., It is a misconception of res judicata to assume that the doctrine does not come into operation if a court has not passed on the 'merits' in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation., An adjudication declining to reach such ultimate substantive issues may bar a second attempt to reach them in another court of the State., Such a situation is presented when the first decision is based not on the ground that the distribution of judicial power among the various courts of the State requires the suit to be brought in another court in the State, but on the inaccessibility of all the courts of the State to such litigation., And that is the essence of the present case., The only issue in controversy in the first North Carolina litigation was whether or not all the courts of North Carolina were closed to that litigation., The merits of that issue were adjudicated., And that was the issue raised in the second litigation in North Carolina-that in the federal district court., The merits of this issue having been adjudicated, they cannot be relitigated., The 'merits' of a claim are disposed of when hey are refused enforcement., If an asserted federal claim is denied enforcement on a professed local ground, but a so-called local ground which is subject to review here because it is in fact the adjudication of a federal question, then the 'merits' of that claim were adjudicated in the only sense that adjudication of the 'merits' is relevant to the principles of res judicata., A State court can- [330 U.S. 183, 191] not sterilize federal claims by putting on the adjudication a locl label., 6., The merits of this controversy were adjudicated by the North Carolina Supreme Court since that court, or this Court on appeal, might have decided that the North Carolina statute did not bar Bullington's first action., The North Carolina statute might have been found unconstitutional., Federal issues were thus involved in the adjudication by the North Carolina Supreme Court., Bullington knew that there were federal issues in the State suit because he raised them., ...]

       "4  [United States Supreme Court CONE v. WEST VIRGINIA PULP & PAPER CO.(1947), No. 184, Argued: February 3, 1947Decided: March 3, 1947 Motion to Amend Mandate Denied June 16, 1947 See 331 U.S. 794 , 67 S.Ct. 1725., Messrs. H. Wayne Unger, of Walterboro, S.C., and James P. Mozingo, of Darlington, S.C., for petitioner., Messrs. Christie Benet, of Columbia, S.C., and Charles W. Waring of Charleston, S.C., for respondent., Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court., The petitioner brought this action in a South Carolina state court., Upon motion of respondent, it was removed to the Federal District Court because of diversity [330 U.S. 212, 213] of citizenship of the parties., The complaint claimed $25,000 damages upon allegations that the respondent's agents had trespassed upon and cut timber from lands owned by and in the possession of the petitioner., Respondent's answer denied that the petitioner had title or possession of the lands and timbers., Both title and possession became crucial issues in the trial., The burden of proving them rested on the petitioner., 1 When all the evidence of both parties had been introduced, the respondent moved for a directed verdict in its favor on the ground that the petitioner had failed to prove that he either owned or was in possession of the land., 2 This motion was denied., The jury returned a verdict for petitioner for $15, 000, and the court entered judgment on the verdict., The respondent moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence., This motion was denied., Respondent did not move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as it might have done under Rule 50(b) of the [330 U.S. 212, 214] Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which is set out below., 3 The Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the admission of certain evidence offered by the petitioner to prove legal title was prejudicial error., It held that without this improperly admitted evidence petitioner's proof was not sufficient to submit the question of title to the jury., That court also held that petitioner's evidence showing possession was insufficient to go to the jury., It therefore reversed the case., But instead of remanding it to the District Court for a new trial, the Circuit Court of Appeals directed that judgment be entered for respondent., That court has thus construed Rule 50(b) as authorizing an appellate court to direct a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, even though no motion for such a judgment had been made in the District Court within ten days after the jury's discharge., The petition for certiorari challenged the power of an appellate court to direct entry of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict where timely motion for such a judg- [330 U.S. 212, 215] ment had not been made in the District Court., On three previous occasions we have granted certiorari to consider this point but failed to reach it because, upon examination of the evidence, we found it sufficient to justify submission of all three cases to the jury., Conway v. O'Brien, 312 U.S. 492 , 61 S.Ct. 634; Berry v. United States, 312 U.S. 450 , 61 S.Ct. 637; Halliday v. United States, 315 U.S. 94 , 62 S. Ct. 438., In this case we granted certiorari 'limited to the questions of federal procedure raised by the petition for the writ.', 329 U.S. 701 , 67 S.Ct. 57., The point we had in mind was whether a party's failure to make a motion in th District Court for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, as permitted in Rule 50(b), precludes an appellate court from directing entry of such a judgment., Other questions have been discussed here, but we do not consider them., Consequently, we accept, without approving or disapproving, the Circuit Court of Appeals' holding that there was prejudicial error in the admission of evidence and in the submission of the case to the jury., Rule 50(b) contains no language which absolutely requires a trial court to enter judgment notwithstanding the verdict even though that court is persuaded that it erred in failing to direct a verdict for the losing party., The rule provides that the trial court 'may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed.', This 'either-or' language means what it seems to mean, namely, that there are circumstances which might lead the trial court to believe that a new trial rather than a final termination of the trial stage of the controversy would better serve the ends of justice., In short, the rule does not compel a trial judge to enter a judgment notwithstanding the verdict instead of ordering a new trial; it permits him to exercise a discretion to choose between the two alternatives., See Berry v. United States, supra, 312 U.S. 452 , [330 U.S. 212, 216] 453, 61 S.Ct. 638.4, And he can exercise this discretion with a fresh personal knowledge of the issues involved, the kind of evidence given, and the impression made by witnesses., His appraisal of the bona fides of the claims asserted by the litigants is of great value in reaching a conclusion as to whether a new trial should be granted., Determination of whether a new trial should be granted or a judgment entered under Rule 50(b) calls for the judgment in the first instance of the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart., See March v. Philadelphia & West Chester Traction Co., 285 Pa. 413, 418, 132 A. 355; Bunn v. Furstein, 153 Pa.Super. 637, 638, 34 A.2d 924., See also Yutterman v. Sternberg, 8 Cir., 86 F.2d 321, 324, 111 A.L.R. 736., Exercise of this discretion presents to the trial judge an opportunity, after all his rulings have been made and all the evidence has been evaluated, to view the proceedings in a perspective peculiarly available to him alone., He is thus afforded 'a last chance to correct his own errors without delay, expense, or other hardships of an appeal.', See Greer v. Carpenter, 323 Mo. 878, 882, 19 S.W.2d 1046, 1047;, Cf. United States v. Johnson, 327 U.S. 106, 112 , 66 S.Ct. 464, 466. [330 U.S. 212, 217], There are other practical reasons why a litigant should not have his right to a new trial foreclosed without having had the benefit of the trial court's judgment on the question., Take the case where a trial court is about to direct a verdict because of failure of proof in a certain aspect of the case., At that time a litigant might know or have reason to believe that he could fill the crucial gap in the evidence., Traditionally, a plaintiff in such a dilemma has had an unqualifi d right, upon payments of costs, to take a nonsuit in order to file a new action after further preparation, unless the defendant would suffer some plain legal prejudice other than the mere prospect of a second lawsuit., Pleasants v. Fant, 22 Wall. 116, 122; Jones v. S.E.C., 298 U.S. 1, 19 , 20 S., 56 S.Ct. 654, 659, and cases cited., Rule 41(a)(1) preserves this unqualified right of the plaintiff to a dismissal without prejudice prior to the filing of defendant's answer., And after the filing of an answer, Rule 41(a)(2) still permits a trial court to grant a dismissal without prejudice 'upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.', 5 In this case had respondents made a timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the petitioner could have either presented reasons to show why he should have a new trial, or at least asked the court for permission to dismiss., If satisfied from the knowledge acquired from the trial and because of the reasons urged that the ends of justice would best be served by allowing petitioner another chance, the judge could have so provided in his discretion., The respondent failed to submit [330 U.S. 212, 218] a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict to the trial judge in order that he might exercise his discretionary power to determine whether there should be such a judgment, a dismissal or a new trial., In the absence of such a motion, we think the appellate court was without power to direct the District Court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand., It has been suggested that the petitioner could have presented affidavits to the Circuit Court of Appeals to support his claim for a new trial, and that that court could thereupon have remanded the question to the District Court to pass upon it., 6 Such a circuitous method of determining the question cannot be approved., For Rule 50(b) specifically prescribes a period of ten days for making a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict., Yet the method here suggested would enable litigants to extend indefinitely the prescribed ten day period simply by adoption of the expedient of an appeal., Furthermore, it would present the question initially to the appellate court when the primary discretionary responsibility for its decision rests on the District Court., Reversed.

City of Columbia, 195 S.C. 59, 70, 10 S.E.2d 350, 355., But possession may be presumed from proof of legal title., Beaufort Land and Investment Co. v.

Haithcock, 123 S.C. 61, 115 S.E. 727; Code of Laws of South Carolina (1942), 377., Petitioner here undertook to prove possession both by showing that he had legal title and by showing that he had openly and notoriously exercised acts of dominion, possession, and ownership over a long period of years., [ Footnote 2 ], Respondent first moved to dismiss the case on the same grounds under Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c., That rule provides for a dismissal, under the circumstances and conditions there set out where 'upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.', Since substantially the same disposition of the case on the same grounds was later requested by respondent in the motion for a directed verdict, we shall have no occasion further to discuss the motion to dismiss., [ Footnote 3 ] 50(b) 'Reservation of Decision on Motion., Whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion., Within 10 days after the reception of a verdict, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict ...., A motion for a new trial may be joined with this motion, or a new trial may be prayed for in the alternative., If a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed., If no verdict was returned the court may direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed or may order a new trial., [ Footnote 4 ], The Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure in commenting on Rule 50(b) stated that 'A trial court or an appellate court in setting aside a verdict always has discretion, if justice requires it, to order a new trial, instead of directing the entry of judgment., Rule 50(b) states that the court on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 'may either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment' for the moving party.', Report of Proposed Amendments to Rules of Civil Procedure (1946) 66., See also New York Symposium on Federal Rules (1938) 283-284., Compare March v.

50(b)., The Committee said: 'Even on appeal, if the appellate court sets aside his verdict, he may present to the appellate court affidavits to support his claim to a new trial, and the appellate court has power to receive the affidavits and remand the case to the trial court with instructions to consider the affidavits and determine whether a new trial should be allowed.', Report of Proposed
